    'short description Innovative approaches are necessary to make the best use of available building technologies and construction methods to improve climate adaptability and resilience and reduce energy consumption, carbon emissions and resource use in social and affordable housing while delivering housing that is affordable, inclusive and improves well-being, in line with the European Commission’s Affordable Housing Initiative. Call objectives An increasing number of new building technologies and construction methods became available on the market in recent years that can make construction and renovation more sustainable. Current policies and regulations set ambitious standards (e.g., in terms of energy efficiency and carbon footprint), which come with higher initial investment costs, making the provision of sustainable, high-quality social and affordable housing in many European neighbourhoods a challenge. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Develop innovative approaches for the construction of new buildings and the renovation or retrofitting of existing buildings in the social and affordable housing sector. These innovative approaches must relate to how construction and renovation services are defined, procured, delivered, financed and/or managed. Define and implement in two social and affordable housing projects two ambitious packages of measures that comprise building technologies and construction methods already on the market. One package of measures must be applied to a new construction and the other to a building renovation or retrofitting. They will address all of the following: Use existing building technologies and construction methods that improve the efficiency and speed of construction and renovation or retrofitting (such as off-site construction, modular building systems, smart meters, big data analysis, sensors, and predictive maintenance). Use environmentally sustainable practices, such as nature-based solutions or carbon-storing materials to reduce energy consumption, carbon footprint, pollution, and resource use throughout the building''s life cycle while also possibly increasing buildings’ resilience and adaptability to natural, including climate change-induced, and human-made hazards. Ensure that social and affordable housing is aesthetically pleasing and contributes positively to the landscape of the place where it is located, while also respecting local context and the architectural heritage. Improve the well-being, inclusion and general living conditions of all inhabitants. For renovations or retrofitting only: minimise and mitigate, where possible, disruptions for residents and improve accessibility of buildings. Social care homes, elderly houses, and other forms of inclusive housing with residential function complemented with social welfare are also considered as eligible for development and testing of cross-cutting innovative solutions developed by the projects. To achieve this, project consortia may provide financial support to SMEs and social housing actors in the form of Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP). The amount to be granted to each third party may be a maximum of EUR 60 000. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture or design, arts, (civil) engineering, health, etc.). This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals are expected to dedicate at least 0.2% of their total budget to share their intermediate and final results and findings with the Coordination and Support Action ''New European Bauhaus hub for results and impact'' (HORIZON-MISS-2024-NEB-01-03). read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Reduced costs for both the construction and renovation of social and affordable housing without sacrificing quality. Increased availability and affordability of quality housing for diverse and vulnerable populations across Europe. Significantly reduced energy consumption, carbon emissions, and resource use in social and affordable housing as well as improved climate adaptability and resilience to climate change of social and affordable housing. Higher awareness of the construction ecosystem and the real estate sector of innovative approaches that increase affordability and sustainability of housing.',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'short description This topic aims to study the interplay between cultural participation, social connections and civic engagement. The resulting insights can be used to foster and maintain the social fabric of neighbourhoods and support their green transition while addressing other challenges such as the decline in social connections. Call objectives Social connections and cultural participation are core features of individual well-being. Evidence shows a strong association between participation in cultural activities and civic behaviour (such as voting and volunteering), empathy, tolerance, security and social cohesion. Conversely, low interpersonal trust, heightened risk-taking, and disengaged civic attitudes are correlated with an increased sense of loneliness – the lack of meaningful social interactions. Cultural organisations and artistic practices with a social purpose or dimension can help to better connect people, strengthen social fabric, and overcome social boundaries. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Study the conditions under which cultural participation may reinforce the social fabric and civic engagement in neighbourhoods and contribute to the green transition: Review existing evidence and collect relevant data in a systematic, comparable way (at least in relation to some territories or dimensions) and identifying trends, gaps and correlations. Explore the wider benefits of cultural participation for individuals and communities (including those feeling left behind, all risk groups vulnerable and/or marginalised, etc.). Where possible, establish correlations, causal links, detailed descriptions, etc., depending on the proposed methodology. Provide a comprehensive analysis of relevant variables, such as socio-demographic characteristics, context-specific aspects, the presence (or absence) of meeting spaces / social infrastructure, digital literacy, local innovation capacity, polarisation, wellbeing and mental health, safety and crime, loneliness, etc. Propose at least three methods or strategies to foster and maintain the social fabric of neighbourhoods and support their green transition. These strategies, approaches or methodologies have to be guided by evidence. They are demonstrated and monitored in at least three neighbourhoods in different Member States or Associated Countries to analyse their effectiveness and their potential for sustained effects in time, in particular as regards community and civic engagement (in particular of the most marginalised and underrepresented). Based on the research evidence, propose recommendations for public authorities and not-for-profit organisations on how to facilitate cultural participation, including the skills, competencies and partnerships needed for their implementation. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, cultural operators, etc.) and disciplines.

    'short description In the built environment, floor space is considered as a resource. Sufficiency measures seek to optimise the use of existing (vacant and under-utilised) spaces, buildings, and infrastructures. These measures lead to an absolute reduction in demand for new-built floor space, reducing resource consumption, embodied and operational carbon emissions, and other environmental impacts in the built environment. By alleviating strain on land resources, sufficiency measures can help address social issues, such as housing shortages, and reduce infrastructure costs for municipalities. Call objectives Sufficiency is a set of policy measures and practices which reduce the demand for energy, materials, land, water, and other natural resources, while delivering well-being for all within planetary boundaries. It represents an integrated approach to sustainability and circularity, acknowledging and balancing the interplay of decarbonisation and equity. The potential of sufficiency measures in the built environment is yet under-explored due to data constraints, limited understanding of their impacts, and insufficient knowledge exchange. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Test and validate an approach to map and quantify vacant and under-utilised spaces with high sufficiency potential in the built environment. Test and validate at least two sufficiency measures that optimise, repurpose, or expand the use and functionality of space. Proposals are expected to test the proposed sufficiency measures in at least three neighbourhoods in urban, peri-urban and rural areas located in at least three Member States or Associated Countries. Quantify the potential for the proposed sufficiency measures to contribute to an absolute reduction in demand for floor space and resources (including, as a minimum, energy, raw materials, land, and water) in the built environment. Propose and validate solutions to overcome non-technical barriers in the built environment towards sufficiency measures (e.g. regulatory barriers or acceptance). Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture or design, arts, (civil) engineering, etc.). This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals are expected to dedicate at least 0.2% of their total budget to share their intermediate and final results and findings with the Coordination and Support Action ''New European Bauhaus hub for results and impact'' (HORIZON-MISS-2024-NEB-01-03). read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Vacant and under-utilised spaces in buildings and other physical spaces in the built environment are easier to map, enabling better informed and effective decision-making in the built environment. Sufficiency measures, their non-technical barriers as well as their environmental, economic and social impacts are better understood by the built environment professionals such as real estate actors, urban planners or designers. Validated sufficiency measures, integrating circular economy principles, lead to an absolute reduction in demand of the built environment for energy, raw materials, land, water, floor space, and other resources; while extending the lifecycle of spaces, buildings, and infrastructures.',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description This topic supports informal networking among neighbourhoods to exchange knowledge and experiences, build their capacity, facilitate innovation in policymaking to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification – including green gentrification – that may result from interventions aligned with the New European Bauhaus. Call objectives Strategies and interventions to regenerate neighbourhoods may lead to gentrification, a process that can bring revitalization, sustainable economic growth, diversity and integration but also segregation, insecurity, exclusion, displacement, loss of cultural identity, and socio-economic inequality. Mitigating the negative consequences of gentrification cannot be achieved without policy innovation. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Create a bottom-up network of neighbourhoods with a (potential) risk of gentrification, to facilitate peer exchange among all relevant stakeholders. Proposals should aim for the participation of at least 15 neighbourhoods located in urban, peri-urban and rural areas from different Member States and Associated Countries. Map neighbourhoods’ needs, challenges, trends and opportunities to inform policies and interventions that mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification and of integrating the New European Bauhaus values and principles. Identify, document, and disseminate current knowledge, evidence, policy design, tools, and best practices for tackling gentrification and translate the results into useful tools that address the identified needs, challenges and opportunities. Support local decision makers in better understanding: The main drivers of gentrification (such as overtourism, interim use and short term rental markets). The effect of housing market speculation, rental agreements and (lack of) housing policies (e.g. fiscal measures, funding instruments, legislative measures) on gentrification. The effects of gentrification on different socio-demographic groups, as well as on local identities and cultural heritage. The interplay between urban, peri-urban and rural gentrification. Address the issue of gentrification in the participating neighbourhoods through at least one of the following actions: Develop or revise local policies (such as those on social/economic/urban development, housing, planning, mobility, green transition) to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification. Develop neighbourhood regeneration strategies that include measures to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as local or regional public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, cultural institutions, etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture, urban design, design, arts, (civil) engineering).

However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',
