    'short description The projects are expected to contribute to new capture technologies (either from points sources or directly from air) should lead to reduced overall cost of capture, as well as lowest possible negative environmental impact, including water use. Call objectives Development of new or emerging capture technologies with high potential for cost reduction. Proposals shall address capture of CO2 either from one of the following areas (and explicitly identify which is being covered): Point sources, or Directly from air (direct air capture, DAC). Depending on the capture routes chosen (e.g., solvents, sorbents, membranes, cryogenic, solid looping), examples of important issues to address include enhanced absorption/adsorption, improved kinetics and reduced energy use for CO2 capture and desorption, new materials with high selectivity for CO2 capture, flexibility of operation, modularisation and scale-up, space occupation, degradation and life span of capture materials, ability for retrofit, potential for heat integration, and solvent-induced corrosion. In particular for DAC, examples of important issues to address are novel sorbent or solvent materials that have higher CO2 capture capacities and longer-term stability in the presence of heat and air. For all proposals, minimisation of health and environmental impact must be addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up. The developed technologies should aim at delivering CO2 at the specifications required for transport and storage, with very low levels of impurities. For point-source capture, the technologies should address the performance profile and characteristic when operating under variable operating conditions such as load changes to maintain and as high as possible capture rate across the entire operating profile. Results from point-source capture should provide good matches between specific industrial application and capture technology while guaranteeing the quality and continuity of the industrial process. The use of the European Research Infrastructure for CO2 Capture, Utilisation, Transport and Storage ECCSEL is encouraged but not mandatory. In particular for DAC, international cooperation with participating countries of the Mission Innovation Carbon Dioxide Removal Mission is encouraged. read more',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'short description Metal halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention because of their low-cost fabrication and high efficiency. In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices. Dedicated manufacturing processes and equipment need also be demonstrated. Call objectives Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects: Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices; Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules; Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination; Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials; Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology. Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process. Proposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer. Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. read more Expected results The rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past decade makes it the most promising next generation photovoltaic technology, owing to its prominent advantages such as tuneable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, uncomplicated preparation process and considerable power conversion efficiency which has reached a certified 26.7% at cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base; Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components; Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. read more',

This call is only open for specific actions: Short supply chains, Social innovations for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups; Inclusive and quality education; Family and community-based health care services; Cross-border development of healthcare institutions. Call objectives The following priorities and specific objectives have been developed within the programme. Please note that only specific actions are eligible under this call: P1: Green cooperations SO 1.1: Promoting transition to a circular and resource efficient economy Action: Short supply chains P2: Social cooperations SO 2.1: Enhancing access to quality employment through developing social infrastructure and promoting social economy Action: Social innovations for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups SO 2.2: Improving equal access to inclusive and quality services in education Action: Inclusive and quality education SO 2.3: Ensuring equal access to health care Action: Family and community-based health care services Action: Cross-border development of healthcare institutions read more Expected results Please find below an overview of the different actions. Each action has specific objectives, supported activities, main target groups and terms and conditions. For more details, please consult the call document p. 11- 53. Action: Short supply chains The action contributes to the creation of short supply chains involving farmers, food producers, craftsmen and consumers with close geographical and social links and a shared commitment to local economic development in the cross-border region of Hungary and Slovakia. The proposed actions contribute to increasing opportunities and knowledge about short supply chains (SSC), especially with regard to today''s nutritional needs, food awareness and modern food production. The overall objectives of the Action are the followings: development of cross-border collaborations to improve the position of smallholder farmers and food producers in value chains increasing the retention of money in the local economy and agrotourism by supporting local producers and suppliers, services and local businesses producing more environmentally friendly products by reducing food miles and pollution building knowledge about the link between consumption and its impact on the environment through mindful consumption support pilot projects of SSC actors which represent a small-scale, time-limited trial designed to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact of a concept, product, or service before full-scale implementation. Action: Social innovations for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups The proposed action aims to improve the employability of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, facilitate their integration into the labour market, create quality and sustainable jobs and forms of employment, and combat poverty and social exclusion. Disadvantaged and vulnerable groups include persons excluded from the labour market, coming from segregated or marginalised communities and face various difficulties when entering the labour market (qualification, professional or personal deficits, regional disadvantages). Social innovations should improve the employability, reduce unemployment and underemployment, strengthen labour market participation and integration, social inclusion and the quality of life of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. Due to the complexity of the unmet needs of the target groups, complex projects should be developed, involving several complementary activities tailored to the needs of the target groups. The action supports the joint development or adaptation of social innovations that representing new methods and approaches to address unmet social needs based on new knowledge, experience and expertise. The program promotes cross-border cooperation and partnerships involving multiple stakeholders, enabling joint innovation (development of new methods, networks, services, and cooperation) and joint implementation of pilot projects which are small-scale, time-limited trials designed to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact of a concept, product, or service before full-scale implementation. Action: Inclusive and quality education The action aims to promote cross-border co-operation in building inclusive and high-performing education systems for educational communities with the presence of disadvantaged learners, aiming to foster their inclusion and equal participation. Disadvantaged learners include students from low-income families, coming from segregated or marginalised communities and students with learning, behavioural or developmental difficulties and disabilities. The action aims to improve educational outcomes and ensure equitable access to meaningful education and reduce the number of early school dropout. Integrated development – linking infrastructure investments with pedagogical innovation – is at the centre of this approach, as is the strengthening of teachers'' skills and the use of digital and AI-powered educational tools. The programme promotes cross-border cooperation and multi-stakeholder partnerships that enable mutual learning in particular local adaptation of best practises, knowledge exchange, joint innovation and the joint implementation of pilot projects aimed at sustainable change in formal and non-formal education institutions. Action: Family and community-based health care services The aim of the action is to improve access to healthcare, health literacy and thus the health status of thepopulation living in the programme area by supporting communities and families with activities, services and equipment that can be used by the population on both sides of the border. The action promotes family-based healthcare characterised by: holistic care for all family members across all ages prevention and early intervention such as immunisation maternal and child health services health education tailored to the family unit and support in managing chronic diseases in the home environment. The action also promotes community-based health services provided locally by health centres, outreach clinics or mobile health units. These include: involvement of community health workers or volunteers trained in primary health care public health programmes such as vaccination campaigns, sanitation and vector control health promotion activities such as awareness campaigns, screening and nutrition programmes and focus on equity and aim to reach underserved and vulnerable populations. Both countries are struggling with a shortage of general practitioners and doctors in outpatient sector. The ageing of the medical population, especially of general practitioners, is a serious challenge for the healthcare system. It is therefore important to support young doctors entering general practise and ensure that the system allows them a smooth transition into the world of work. The action supports the introduction of new technologies and approaches that improve the accessibility, efficiency and quality of healthcare in the general practitioner’s sector. The most important of these include digital transformation, personalised medicine, integrated care, prevention and education. Action: Cross-border development of healthcare institutions The action facilitates border crossings, that will promote the mobility of patients and healthcare professionals and improve access to quality healthcare services in the border area. In many cases there are parallel capacities and at the same time a lack of medical care on both sides of the border. The main aim of the actions is to further develop the healthcare facilities in the border region through a more efficient use of spatial, instrumental, electronic and innovative solutions in the provision of healthcare services and to use these improvements to provide services that can also be used for the population from the other side of the border. The aim of the action is to modernise healthcare facilities in the border area based on the real need and the potential cross-border mobility of patients, the lack of and parallel capacities and services of healthcare facilities in order to create truly cross-border healthcare services. read more',

Action: Short supply chains The action contributes to the creation of short supply chains involving farmers, food producers, craftsmen and consumers with close geographical and social links and a shared commitment to local economic development in the cross-border region of Hungary and Slovakia. The proposed actions contribute to increasing opportunities and knowledge about short supply chains (SSC), especially with regard to today''s nutritional needs, food awareness and modern food production. The overall objectives of the Action are the followings: development of cross-border collaborations to improve the position of smallholder farmers and food producers in value chains increasing the retention of money in the local economy and agrotourism by supporting local producers and suppliers, services and local businesses producing more environmentally friendly products by reducing food miles and pollution building knowledge about the link between consumption and its impact on the environment through mindful consumption support pilot projects of SSC actors which represent a small-scale, time-limited trial designed to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact of a concept, product, or service before full-scale implementation. Action: Social innovations for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups The proposed action aims to improve the employability of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, facilitate their integration into the labour market, create quality and sustainable jobs and forms of employment, and combat poverty and social exclusion. Disadvantaged and vulnerable groups include persons excluded from the labour market, coming from segregated or marginalised communities and face various difficulties when entering the labour market (qualification, professional or personal deficits, regional disadvantages). Social innovations should improve the employability, reduce unemployment and underemployment, strengthen labour market participation and integration, social inclusion and the quality of life of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. Due to the complexity of the unmet needs of the target groups, complex projects should be developed, involving several complementary activities tailored to the needs of the target groups. The action supports the joint development or adaptation of social innovations that representing new methods and approaches to address unmet social needs based on new knowledge, experience and expertise. The program promotes cross-border cooperation and partnerships involving multiple stakeholders, enabling joint innovation (development of new methods, networks, services, and cooperation) and joint implementation of pilot projects which are small-scale, time-limited trials designed to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact of a concept, product, or service before full-scale implementation. Action: Inclusive and quality education The action aims to promote cross-border co-operation in building inclusive and high-performing education systems for educational communities with the presence of disadvantaged learners, aiming to foster their inclusion and equal participation. Disadvantaged learners include students from low-income families, coming from segregated or marginalised communities and students with learning, behavioural or developmental difficulties and disabilities. The action aims to improve educational outcomes and ensure equitable access to meaningful education and reduce the number of early school dropout. Integrated development – linking infrastructure investments with pedagogical innovation – is at the centre of this approach, as is the strengthening of teachers'' skills and the use of digital and AI-powered educational tools. The programme promotes cross-border cooperation and multi-stakeholder partnerships that enable mutual learning in particular local adaptation of best practises, knowledge exchange, joint innovation and the joint implementation of pilot projects aimed at sustainable change in formal and non-formal education institutions. Action: Family and community-based health care services The aim of the action is to improve access to healthcare, health literacy and thus the health status of thepopulation living in the programme area by supporting communities and families with activities, services and equipment that can be used by the population on both sides of the border. The action promotes family-based healthcare characterised by: holistic care for all family members across all ages prevention and early intervention such as immunisation maternal and child health services health education tailored to the family unit and support in managing chronic diseases in the home environment. The action also promotes community-based health services provided locally by health centres, outreach clinics or mobile health units. These include: involvement of community health workers or volunteers trained in primary health care public health programmes such as vaccination campaigns, sanitation and vector control health promotion activities such as awareness campaigns, screening and nutrition programmes and focus on equity and aim to reach underserved and vulnerable populations. Both countries are struggling with a shortage of general practitioners and doctors in outpatient sector. The ageing of the medical population, especially of general practitioners, is a serious challenge for the healthcare system. It is therefore important to support young doctors entering general practise and ensure that the system allows them a smooth transition into the world of work. The action supports the introduction of new technologies and approaches that improve the accessibility, efficiency and quality of healthcare in the general practitioner’s sector. The most important of these include digital transformation, personalised medicine, integrated care, prevention and education. Action: Cross-border development of healthcare institutions The action facilitates border crossings, that will promote the mobility of patients and healthcare professionals and improve access to quality healthcare services in the border area. In many cases there are parallel capacities and at the same time a lack of medical care on both sides of the border. The main aim of the actions is to further develop the healthcare facilities in the border region through a more efficient use of spatial, instrumental, electronic and innovative solutions in the provision of healthcare services and to use these improvements to provide services that can also be used for the population from the other side of the border. The aim of the action is to modernise healthcare facilities in the border area based on the real need and the potential cross-border mobility of patients, the lack of and parallel capacities and services of healthcare facilities in order to create truly cross-border healthcare services. read more',
