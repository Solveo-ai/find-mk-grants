University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project Partnership All organisations that are eligible for funding under the Horizon Europe programme can apply. You do not have to be an existing partner organisation of EIT RawMaterials to apply for funding, but by becoming one, you will gain access to a valuable source of expertise and potential collaborators. They will work with you and help build your consortium if, or when, you decide to apply for funding. We also encourage our partners and stakeholders from industry, research, and education, including start-ups and SMEs, to submit new project proposals. These projects should demonstrate how they will impact significantly on European industrial competitiveness, innovation capacity, and human capital, as well as empower students and entrepreneurs advancing the circular economy and the green and digital transition goals of the European Green Deal. The project Consortium must consist of a minimum of two Project participants, coming from a minimum of two different countries eligible for Horizon Europe funding, and a maximum of 5 Project participants. No more than 80% of the grant can go to one of the partner. The lead Project participant must be a Core or Associate Partner (or Linked Third Party to a Core or Associate Partner) of EIT RawMaterials by the time the project starts. The project Consortium must include Project participants from at least two sides of the knowledge triangle (education, research, industry/business - as defined in the Partner registration documentation). All EIT RawMaterials’ policies, including on diversity and inclusion, apply. Project participants that are non-members are eligible to apply as Members only if they submit an EIT RawMaterials membership application before the project starts. Failure to apply for EIT RawMaterials membership will result in their removal (including the requested funding) from the proposal (note that the project will be immediately terminated if eligibility criteria are not met at this stage). other eligibility criteria Upscaling KAVA projects are innovation projects based on validated technologies that need additional step(s) for testing, demonstration, proof of concept and up-scaling prior to commercialization. The purpose of these projects is to support good technologies, products, and services that are currently under development to reach market entry. All Projects must lead to specific deliverables and outputs over a defined timeline. Projects will be financed by EIT RawMaterials (the KIC) only for a defined duration. Proposals must meet the highest expectations and performance on the creation of impact (please refer to Strategic Agenda 2021-2027). This is mainly measured by achieving Core KPIs. Only the Proposals that are fully aligned with the EIT RawMaterials 2021-2027 Strategic Agenda will be considered for funding. In particular, the Proposal should address at least one of the topics listed in the Lighthouse Appendix and must be developed in close cooperation with the KIC staff that have been assigned to the Proposal. Proposals that do not address the topics listed in the Lighthouse Appendix will be considered for funding, but will be given lower priority The EIT RawMaterials Lighthouses are the following: Circular Societies Sustainable Materials Responsible Sourcing Upscaling Projects must aim for market introduction and/or a commercial use within 2 years or less after the end of Project, and shorter time for market introduction and/or a commercial use will be favourably evaluated. Projects that aim for commercialization within the project duration will be evaluated positively. The proposal must clearly state who (which Project participant) will be responsible for commercialisation, and outline a plan for market introduction. The Project should outline the Commercialising partners’ profile and/or main characteristics and must demonstrate that they have experienced marketing/finance/sales people on the team. Upscaling Projects need to be based on a solid market analysis, covering important aspects such as the business environment (e.g., technical, regulatory, social, environmental and political aspects, user needs and targeted applications, customer value proposition, target market(s) (e.g., size, structure, growth potential, segmentation), risk assessment, design or market studies, and intellectual property exploration. A preliminary market analysis must be included in the Proposal and will be the basis for the Go-to-market strategy that will be developed in Work Package 0 (WP0) during the project. The Go-to-market strategy will be updated throughout the duration of the Project and enable go/no-go decisions following quarterly or annual reviews. No-go decisions may result in various consequences, such as suspension or discontinuation of the funding. Projects that have the potential to become investment cases for the European Raw Materials Alliance within the funding period will be evaluated positively and will be given a priority over other projects that have achieved a similar score in the quality criteria. The technology must be at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 5 at the beginning of the project, corresponding to a “system complete and qualified”. Information must be provided in the Proposal to substantiate in detail how this will be achieved. The Project may be scored very low or even deemed to be ineligible without a detailed and convincing substantiation of this condition. At the end of the project, the technology is expected to have reached a TRL of at least 8, corresponding to a “system prototype demonstration in operational environment”. Information must be provided in the application to substantiate this claim, and the project may be scored very low or even deemed to be ineligible without it. Consortia are encouraged to consider offering our EIT RM Alumni an internship in their project and/or a site visit. Our Alumni are past or present participants in EIT RM Education, Innovation or Business Development activities and we strongly encourage you to register to the EIT Raw Materials Alumni community that is open not only to students. Indeed the EIT RM Alumni Association would assist in the logistics involved in an internship or study/Project visit. Proposals claiming to achieve any positive environmental impact, such as resource and energy savings, waste reduction, waste valorisation, emissions reduction, etc., must include a Work Package on the assessment of the environmental impacts of the developed products or processes using LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) methodologies.',

    'short description Better knowledge of how common spaces affect social relations is required to scale up successful common space initiatives across Europe. This topic seeks to produce insights on the impacts of common spaces (new, redesigned or redeveloped) on neighbourhoods and their communities. Call objectives One of the core NEB values is inclusion. The regeneration of common spaces can facilitate inclusiveness and social interaction in neighbourhoods by providing a safe, accessible, and attractive environment. Attractive, well-designed, well-maintained, and secure common spaces can bring people together for commercial, cultural, and leisure activities. A safe environment can also create a sense of trust and community among inhabitants. Recognising a neighbourhood''s diversity “not only improves social and spatial cohesion but also contributes to democratic, peaceful coexistence”. Social, economic, and cultural services and amenities that reflect this diversity and allow for people to come together and interact, can have a particular impact on inclusion and can lead to new forms of collaboration, solidarity and social recognition. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Study a range of common space projects in at least three EU Member States or Associated Countries, collecting data and drawing on evidence, to better understand: The medium and long-term impacts of common spaces on community cohesion, social interactions, active civic participation, resilience, diversity, as well as sense of security and belonging. This includes identifying if and to what extent these impacts vary in neighbourhoods with different characteristics, for example, in terms of social infrastructure, economy, housing ownership patterns, services, etc. How the design and maintenance of common spaces (including the process, for example relying on participatory approaches), the degradation of the bordering built environment, and the preservation of cultural heritage, influences the above identified effects of common space. How the integration of the three core NEB values in the design of common spaces impacts the above identified effects of common space. How the different groups of people (such as women, children, youth, older adults, people with disabilities, underrepresented, vulnerable and marginalised groups, LGBTIQA+) make use of and experience common spaces. How variations in the use of common spaces in different periods of the year influence community cohesion, social interactions, and civic participation. Based on the research evidence, provide recommendations for public administrations and other stakeholders involved in the regeneration of common spaces in neighbourhoods. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, cultural institutions, etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture or design, arts, (civil) engineering). This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals are expected to dedicate at least 0.2% of their total budget to share their intermediate and final results and findings with the Coordination and Support Action ''New European Bauhaus hub for results and impact'' (HORIZON-MISS-2024-NEB-01-03). read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Better understanding of the effects of the design, aesthetics and other features of common spaces on inhabitants’ behaviour (including e.g. their social interactions and recognition, civic participation, use of spaces and buildings), health, sense of belonging, diversity and inclusion, security, resilience, and opportunities to produce social, cultural and local economic value. Enhanced capacities of relevant stakeholders to integrate insights in policies, strategies, plans and measures for the regeneration of common spaces in neighbourhoods.',

The regeneration of common spaces can facilitate inclusiveness and social interaction in neighbourhoods by providing a safe, accessible, and attractive environment. Attractive, well-designed, well-maintained, and secure common spaces can bring people together for commercial, cultural, and leisure activities. A safe environment can also create a sense of trust and community among inhabitants. Recognising a neighbourhood''s diversity “not only improves social and spatial cohesion but also contributes to democratic, peaceful coexistence”. Social, economic, and cultural services and amenities that reflect this diversity and allow for people to come together and interact, can have a particular impact on inclusion and can lead to new forms of collaboration, solidarity and social recognition. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Study a range of common space projects in at least three EU Member States or Associated Countries, collecting data and drawing on evidence, to better understand: The medium and long-term impacts of common spaces on community cohesion, social interactions, active civic participation, resilience, diversity, as well as sense of security and belonging. This includes identifying if and to what extent these impacts vary in neighbourhoods with different characteristics, for example, in terms of social infrastructure, economy, housing ownership patterns, services, etc. How the design and maintenance of common spaces (including the process, for example relying on participatory approaches), the degradation of the bordering built environment, and the preservation of cultural heritage, influences the above identified effects of common space. How the integration of the three core NEB values in the design of common spaces impacts the above identified effects of common space. How the different groups of people (such as women, children, youth, older adults, people with disabilities, underrepresented, vulnerable and marginalised groups, LGBTIQA+) make use of and experience common spaces. How variations in the use of common spaces in different periods of the year influence community cohesion, social interactions, and civic participation. Based on the research evidence, provide recommendations for public administrations and other stakeholders involved in the regeneration of common spaces in neighbourhoods. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, cultural institutions, etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture or design, arts, (civil) engineering). This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals are expected to dedicate at least 0.2% of their total budget to share their intermediate and final results and findings with the Coordination and Support Action ''New European Bauhaus hub for results and impact'' (HORIZON-MISS-2024-NEB-01-03). read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Better understanding of the effects of the design, aesthetics and other features of common spaces on inhabitants’ behaviour (including e.g. their social interactions and recognition, civic participation, use of spaces and buildings), health, sense of belonging, diversity and inclusion, security, resilience, and opportunities to produce social, cultural and local economic value. Enhanced capacities of relevant stakeholders to integrate insights in policies, strategies, plans and measures for the regeneration of common spaces in neighbourhoods.',
