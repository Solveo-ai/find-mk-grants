    'short description The Danube Region Programme (DRP) is launching the 3rd Call for Proposals (CfP). The programme offers financial support to transnational projects contributing to the development of a more innovative, sustainable and more social Danube Region. The programme has been designed under the territorial cooperation goal of the European Union. The uniqueness of the programme consists of offering a platform for cooperation in strategic areas between EU Member States and non-EU Partner States in the Danube region. In this CfP, applicants can submit proposals under the following Specific Objectives: SO1.2, SO2.1, SO2.2, SO2.3, SO3.1. SO3.2 and SO4.2. Furthermore, this CfP is a targeted call. It means that only proposals addressing the thematic focuses defined in the Call announcement can be funded by the Programme. Call objectives Specific Objective 1.2 - Development of skills for advancing smart specialisation strategies, industrial transformation and transition towards industry 4.0, including cross-sectorial collaborations 3rd call thematic focus: AI skills development for delivering products and services with transnational impact in the Danube Region Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and redefining how businesses operate globally. In the Danube Region, there is an urgent need to equip organisations with AI-related skills to enhance competitiveness, drive innovation, and ensure sustainable economic growth. This 3rd call thematic scope is also strongly linked to the EC COM (2025) 163 A modernised Cohesion policy: The mid-term review stating that “digitalisation of public services and the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the public and private sectors are levers for competitiveness. This 3rd CfP is targeting projects that foster AI skills development, enabling primarily public and private non-profit organisations supporting businesses, start-ups, and professionals to leverage AI technologies for transnational collaboration, digital transformation, and creation of high-value products and services. Specific Objective 2.1 - Support greening the energy and transport sectors in the Danube Region by enhancing the integration of renewable energy sources 3rd call thematic focus: Considering the provisions outlined in the “Energy transition” section of “A modernised Cohesion policy: The mid-term review” (MTR, COM(2025) 163 final) published by the European Commission and taking into account the still growing need for sustainable, renewable energy solutions in line with the IP of the Interreg Danube Region highlights the necessity to define a targeted 3rd call for “sustainable renewable energy solutions in the context of energy production, heating and cooling systems, grid load, energy communities, district heating and cooling, storage and peak load reduction” directly linked to focus 1 of SO2.1 “Increasing the share of renewable energy in the Danube region”. Specific Objective 2.2 - Promoting climate change adaptation capacities in the Danube Region and disaster management on transnational level in relation to environmental risks taking into account ecosystem-based approaches 3rd call thematic focus: The proposed applications can address the three thematic focuses of SO 2.2, but should target broader territorial scope beyond the urban, municipal level, where transnational level harmonisation and coordination of forecasting, monitoring, preparedness, or reaction is necessary (targeting the Danube River Basin, or its main sub-basins, or the Danube Region, a thematically reasonable, broad and coherent transnational space within, covering the targeted area in its entirety – e.g. a transnational river network, a broad transnational area of DR affected by the same environmental risk with potential transboundary impact) in connection to climate change adaptation and / or climate change induced environmental risks (floods, droughts, wild fires),or accidental pollution of rivers. Specific Objective 2.3 - Sustainable, integrated, transnational water and sediment management in the Danube River Basin ensuring good quality and quantity of waters and sediment balance 3rd call thematic focus: Proposals can address thematic focus 2 (harmonising management practices between relevant sectors to improve the quality and quantity of transnational water bodies) and thematic focus 3 (transnational coordination of water supply management in transnational river(basin)s) of SO2.3. More specifically, the proposed applications should target potential impacts of climate change on transnational water management by harmonising and coordinating policy approaches, management practises between water management, agriculture, environment, navigation and hydropower to improve the quantity (and quality) of water in transnational river systems of DRB with key topics in relation to water scarcity, balanced use of water and coordinated management of low-water periods on transnational rivers of DRB (considering also that flood management is related to SO 2.2). This thematic scope is also in strong connection with the COM/2025/0084 regulation proposal, which aligns cohesion policy investments to the new challenges and priorities identified by the mid-term review of the Cohesion Policy, among others adding water resilience to the scope of water management. The geographic scope of the proposals shall be on the whole Danube River Basin, or at least a sufficiently broad part of it, major transnational river(s), river basin and possibly in the entirety of the targeted river basin. Specific Objective 3.1 - Accessible, inclusive and effective labour markets 3rd call thematic focus: Capacity building for employment support bodies (information and data systems; coordination; training e.g. in social economy). The context in which employment services are operating in the Danube Region is characterised by rapid change, driven in large part by demographic shifts, migration, digital transformation and the green transition. Consequently, new forms of employment, skills, social attitudes and career paths are needed in the DR to support our labour markets and society more widely. Our aim is to build the capacity of employment services to respond to the challenges and prepare services in support of effective, agile, inclusive and resilient labour markets. This could include new or improved information and data systems; coordinating structures and processes between services and supporting stakeholders; developing service capacity through innovative training methodologies - for example in social economy, AI, skills assessment, inclusion, etc. Indicative examples from one of the DR challenges, of the type of approaches that could fit within the scope of this specific objective can be seen below. Specific Objective 3.2 - Accessible and inclusive quality services in education, training and lifelong learning 3rd call thematic focus 1: To strengthen Danube Region strategic approaches in support of Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs) in the Danube Region. A Danube Region strategic support approach for CoVEs should build on the work of the existing EUSDR Danube Region Platform on Centres of Vocational Excellence/Policy Platform for CoVEs started in 2021 Danube Region Platform on Centres of Vocational Excellence - EUSDR - Danube Strategy Point. A Danube Region project(s) could complement and further develop this initiative with a more coordinating/operational approach, which could include: Pilot programmes of work with a transnational character on specific areas of work, e.g. internationalization of CoVEs, CoVEs and social inclusion, public private partnerships; CoVEs and smart specialization; lifelong learning Creating networks, forums and working groups on specific themes connecting VET policy makers and providers with companies and industry representatives across the Danube Region Developing a support function for the understanding, guidance and complementarity of different programmes in the Danube Region supporting CoVEs (national, regional, transnational) Awareness and capacity building programmes for CoVEs in the Danube Region Strategic CoVE development in fields of transnational interest across the Danube Region 3rd call thematic focus 2: The development of existing CoVEs or new CoVEs - developing their excellence potential Projects should develop on one or more of the following directions: CoVE focussed initiatives to modernise and transform the quality of VET systems to strategically support social, economic and pedagogical changes and challenges, e.g. new skill needs in the context of the green and digital transition The formation of multilevel Public Private Partnerships for VET and skills development Actions aimed towards embedding CoVEs in local innovation ecosystems and connecting them at the Danube level Facilitating the bringing together of CoVEs that share a common interest in specific sectors and innovative approaches to tackling societal challenges e.g. social inclusion, green skills, digitalisation, AI, upskilling individuals with low qualification levels, etc. Specific Objective 4.2 - Increased institutional capacities for territorial and macro-regional governance Four 3rd call thematic focuses have been identified for specific objective 4.2. Applicants are not requested to address all the four thematic focuses of the 3rd call, but they shall concentrate on and demonstrate in their application strong contribution to at least one thematic focus. Addressing two or more thematic focuses is not considered an advantage for the applicant and will not lead to additional points automatically since the assessment considers the quality of the proposal in its entirety. Please find more information below. read more Expected results Specific Objective 1.2 - Development of skills for advancing smart specialisation strategies, industrial transformation and transition towards industry 4.0, including cross-sectorial collaborations The key goals of SO 1.2 in this CfP are: Develop AI-related skills that enhance the delivery of transnational products and services by supporting SMEs, start-ups and professionals in adopting AI-driven solutions for business growth Integration of existing AI solutions into transnational, digital (data-based) ecosystems that utilise technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), block chain, XR, digital twins and cloud solutions Promote ethical AI, data literacy, and responsible AI development across industries Strengthen cooperation between educational institutions, businesses, and policymakers to build an AI-ready workforce Foster AI-driven entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystems in the Danube Region Development of a common transnational AI competence framework for the Danube Region Development and training of methods and tools for SMES in the Danube Region to test and securely operate AI solutions Build on AI-oriented existing, complimentary platforms and services, that contribute to the implementation of the Danube strategy Proposed projects should focus on some of the following areas: AI ethics and governance: development and training on ethical AI use, bias detection, and regulatory compliance to ensure responsible AI deployment AI in entrepreneurship: support for AI start-ups through incubations programs, mentorship, and funding guidance Transnational AI collaboration: joint projects between universities, research centres, and businesses to develop transnational solutions related to the use or application of AI such as: AI training and education: development of AI training programmes, workshops, and certification courses for students and professionals AI for business applications: practical training on AI-powered tools for industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and healthcare AI and digital transformation: programs that help organisations integrate AI into their operations to enhance productivity and efficiency AI for Sustainability: AI-driven innovations for climate monitoring, smart cities, and sustainable resource management Integration of AI solutions into transnational, digital ecosystems Depending on their objectives, successful projects should demonstrate the following: Increased AI literacy and practical AI skills among professionals of public organisations piloted and tested in their role of supporting businesses in delivering transnational products and services Development of AI-based learning materials, training platforms, and certification programmes Strengthened transnational collaboration in AI research and development AI-driven solutions that enhance economic and social development Measures that enable SMEs to better utilise AI Increased connection of stakeholders with AI experience with SMEs that lack experience Cooperation with existing and well-functioning organizational structures under the EU Strategy for Danube Region Specific Objective 2.1 - Support greening the energy and transport sectors in the Danube Region by enhancing the integration of renewable energy sources To maximise the impact generated by corresponding activities the call is focused on small and medium municipalities to motivate them to participate in the energy transition. Applicants are encouraged to make use of the capitalization opportunities with ongoing 1st call projects like Danube geoHeCo, REHEATEAST, StoreMore, ESINERGY, SMEnergy, NRGCOM, and DECA, Danube Indeet who already created topic-wise a good foundation that could possibly be taken up or even developed further. To facilitate financing solutions for relevant investments for small and medium municipalities, initiatives such as the European City Facility (EUCF) - that was set up under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation of the European Union, and is currently being funded as part of the Life Programme - is also recommended. Specific Objective 2.2 - Promoting climate change adaptation capacities in the Danube Region and disaster management on transnational level in relation to environmental risks taking into account ecosystem-based approaches no further specifications Specific Objective 2.3 - Sustainable, integrated, transnational water and sediment management in the Danube River Basin ensuring good quality and quantity of waters and sediment balance no further specifications Specific Objective 3.1 - Accessible, inclusive and effective labour markets Indicative examples (non-exhaustive): Creation of an information system and support for the provision of information and data about life events connected to the periodic and permanent migration of workforce, caused by labour market inequalities between the eastern and the western parts of the macro region Build-up of a “Danube observatory system” about labour migration and its impacts on cohesion, involving public bodies responsible for monitoring and evaluation, academia and civil society Specific Objective 3.2 - Accessible and inclusive quality services in education, training and lifelong learning Vocational education and training systems demonstrate a range of approaches in the fourteen countries of the Danube Region (DR), varying based on national and regional policies, cultural values, and economic and social needs. However, significant common connections and challenges bind labour markets, supportive VET systems, providers and learners together. These include demographic change, migration, digital transformation and the green transition, which are all testing the agility of VET systems to meet the needs of changing labour markets and society. The Danube Region Programme recognises the importance of addressing this with transnational partnerships to complement national, regional and local initiatives. Working through Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs), the programme seeks to do this with two approaches. One strategic and one more operational. In considering CoVEs, the programme recognises that there is not a single uniform accepted definition of a CoVE, but it considers all of the following characteristics to be important in CoVE identification: recognised in its field as high-quality VET provision role in promoting regional development and employment local skills ecosystem: hub for innovation and knowledge transfer, and fostering collaboration between education, businesses, the community, public administration and other stakeholders connected and active internationally Well-considered applications should create a differentiated understanding in terms of their CoVE identification as opposed to the more standard VET providers/provision. The programme also considers excellence in the context of CoVEs as a wide-reaching and inclusive concept of skills provision which encompasses pedagogy, social justice, lifelong learning, transversal skills, organization, innovation, continuing professional education and community needs. Specific Objective 4.2 - Increased institutional capacities for territorial and macro-regional governance 3rd call thematic focus 1: Tackling the accelerated territorial peripheralization/ polarization within the Danube Region and promoting balanced territorial and social-economic development, considering main demographic developments and recent technological advances Increasing regional disparities are a specific feature of the Danube Region and closely connected to beneath working demographic trends like brain drain, depopulation or deterioration of rural and remote areas. In addition, recent technological advances have the potential to further “fuel” the already ongoing territorial polarization. These inter-linked phenomena are not only aggravating the living-conditions in wide areas of the Danube Region and for certain demographic groups (e.g. youth, elderly or low-qualified workers) but are affecting the (global) competitiveness of the Danube Region as such. Projects tackling single aspects in this field have been (successfully) realised, yet a much broader and comprehensive strategic initiatives are needed for filling evidence gaps, defining a common territorial vision and introducing targeted and sustainable measures for mitigating or reversing existing mis-developments. Main activities shall be grouped around improving and transnationally harmonizing the evidence-base in relation to the topics concerned, a better and more effective alignment of policies needed for counter-balancing the accelerated polarisation within the Danube region and the empowerment of local actors for successfully testing and implementing sustainable solutions. Main outputs and results shall cover a governance model vertically and horizontally integrating core-actors in the field concerned, evidence-based and transnationally applicable policy documents as well as tools and action plans for their local implementation. 3rd call thematic focus 2: Making local (and regional) public governance systems more resilient to crisis-situations (“crisis proof”) The COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine showed that crisis-situations not known for decades (or not known at all) suddenly can become real and influence basically all spheres of life. A specific contribution of SO4.2 in this context could consist in developing a framework for improving capacities for the crisis-preparedness especially of local public bodies in fields such as civil protection, maintaining critical infrastructure, dealing with de-stabilizing actions like cyber-attacks or misinformation and providing vital public services. Main activities shall tackle the analysis of crisis-scenarios especially in view of capacities needed for ensuring an adequate preparedness of local actors in the most vital fields, the creation of transnational coordination mechanisms in the field concerned. The main outputs and results are to be seen in an integrated transnational governance system for crisis-preparedness overcoming the existent fragmentation (in terms key-actors, frameworks and mechanisms) along “traditional” intervention fields like health, environment or safety. 3rd call thematic focus 3: Innovating and optimizing models of effectively involving citizens in transnational, multi-level territorial planning processes and promoting sustainable democracy Models of local self-government and community engagement are multifaceted and have a long tradition in the Danube Region. Yet the big pictures shows that many of Europe’s “low-trust-societies” with a low level of active participation in civil society are concentrated on this cooperation area. Larger strategic initiatives are an adequate tool for pooling existing experiences and key-actors and for introducing and testing new models. Whereas democratic participation in general decision making and territorial planning processes can be seen as the core-challenge in this field, new emerging phenomena (like the need for improved media literacy for confronting disinformation campaigns and fake news spreading through digital media) shall be considered too, not only, but also because they affect in particular the youth. Main activities shall focus on the creation and testing of new models for local civic participation or the role – potentials, limitations, risks – of new technological phenomena like social media or AI in increasing institutional trust in the Danube Region. The main output/result envisaged is a platform acting as an incubator for innovating participation models and tools and for boosting the cooperation among key civic actors across the cooperation area. 3rd call thematic focus 4: Strengthening transnational capacities of public local and regional governance systems for ensuring the functioning of Global / European / Danubian Value Chains The war in Ukraine highlighted the complex connections within global value chains and how disruptions in one area can affect different sectors and regions across the EU. The Danube Region – as Europe’s macro-region directly neighbouring a geopolitically more and more instable space – is both more exposed to threads resulting from recent developments and can at the same time contribute more and more directly to overcome (or mitigate) these threads. S.O.4.2 could offer a platform for tackling a specific aspect in this context, i.e. the role of local and regional governments in their interaction with businesses and civil actors for ensuring an effective and sustainable functioning of vital value chains. Main activities shall aim at analysing the vulnerability of crucial value chains from a transnational perspective and the role of local public bodies for ensuring their effective functioning. The main output/result is to be seen in the creation of a coordination mechanism for Danubian value chains and increased capacities of local public bodies for sustaining critical value chains. read more',

Larger strategic initiatives are an adequate tool for pooling existing experiences and key-actors and for introducing and testing new models. Whereas democratic participation in general decision making and territorial planning processes can be seen as the core-challenge in this field, new emerging phenomena (like the need for improved media literacy for confronting disinformation campaigns and fake news spreading through digital media) shall be considered too, not only, but also because they affect in particular the youth. Main activities shall focus on the creation and testing of new models for local civic participation or the role – potentials, limitations, risks – of new technological phenomena like social media or AI in increasing institutional trust in the Danube Region. The main output/result envisaged is a platform acting as an incubator for innovating participation models and tools and for boosting the cooperation among key civic actors across the cooperation area. 3rd call thematic focus 4: Strengthening transnational capacities of public local and regional governance systems for ensuring the functioning of Global / European / Danubian Value Chains The war in Ukraine highlighted the complex connections within global value chains and how disruptions in one area can affect different sectors and regions across the EU. The Danube Region – as Europe’s macro-region directly neighbouring a geopolitically more and more instable space – is both more exposed to threads resulting from recent developments and can at the same time contribute more and more directly to overcome (or mitigate) these threads. S.O.4.2 could offer a platform for tackling a specific aspect in this context, i.e. the role of local and regional governments in their interaction with businesses and civil actors for ensuring an effective and sustainable functioning of vital value chains. Main activities shall aim at analysing the vulnerability of crucial value chains from a transnational perspective and the role of local public bodies for ensuring their effective functioning. The main output/result is to be seen in the creation of a coordination mechanism for Danubian value chains and increased capacities of local public bodies for sustaining critical value chains. read more',

    'short description The call invites organisations from across central Europe to submit transnational cooperation ideas for strategic projects for capitalisation, using the potential to team up efforts between cross-border and transnational projects, strengthening the impact of Interreg as a whole for the benefit of the central Europe area. The overall objective of the call is to reduce the effects of borders on flows and functional linkages among central European regions, for a more competitive and resilient central Europe. Call objectives The programme mission is to bring regions and cities together beyond borders to find fitting solutions for their citizens – in a fair and equal way everywhere. It encourages and supports transnational cooperation to make regions more resilient to common challenges that know no borders and which cannot be solved alone. These challenges include among others economic transition processes, climate change, and the long-term socioeconomic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. The programme priorities and specific objectives form the backbone of the Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE funding strategy in 2021-27. In line with the thematic fields, transnational cooperation actions are expected to address the development and implementation of strategies, action plans, tools, training, pilot actions and related solutions. All actions will have to respect the horizontal principles of sustainable development including environmental protection as well as equal opportunities, non-discrimination and gender equality. Priority 1: Cooperating for a smarter central Europe SO 1.1 Strengthening innovation capacities in central Europe Strong innovation capacities bear enormous relevance for central Europe considering its strong industrial base and the importance of sectors such as agriculture and food, or tourism. Innovation is also central for strengthening central Europe’s economic resilience. Capacities for innovation need to be fostered especially in regions that are struggling with the transition to a more globalised, digitalised and green economy. Knowledge and technology transfer, especially for SMEs, is a critical need. SO 1.2 Strenghtening skills for smart specialisation, industrial transition and entrepreneurship in central Europe The strong industrial base of central Europe and its dependence on adequate skills underlines the strategic relevance of this specific objective. SMEs have been identified as the main providers of employment in central Europe and it is important to foster locally available human skills, especially for the transition to Industry 4.0, digitalisation and a green economy. Capacities for an efficient entrepreneurial discovery process need to be improved as well as for the preparation or updating of smart specialisation strategies. Place-based development of skills is also crucial for reducing urban-rural disparities. Overall, there is the need for a just transition process that is socially responsible. Priority 2: Cooperating for a greener central Europe SO 2.1 Supporting the energy transition to a climate-neutral central Europe Central Europe needs to speed up its performance related both to energy efficiency as well as the production and use of renewable energy to meet EU targets and climate objectives of the European Green Deal. Significant regional disparities between central European regions have to be tackled. Energy efficiency and renewable energy need to be promoted and exploited to reach a wider geographical coverage. SO 2.2. Increasing the resilience to climate change risks in central Europe Resilience to climate change risks represents an important need for central Europe, especially in view of its significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. A specific territorial aspect is the need for integrated and cross-sectoral approaches to best adapt to climate change. In order to build up climate resilience, general approaches need to be locally adapted towards workable and manageable, integrated solutions which can be proliferated across the entire central Europe area. SO 2.3. Taking circular economy forward in central Europe A climate-neutral, resource-efficient and competitive economy requires up-scaled circular approaches. This economic transformation has to pay attention to the fact that a circular economy will often require a re- arrangement of value chains, changes of interdependencies and the creation of new profit options. It is important that this socio-economic transformation happens across the entire territory of central Europe and does not concentrate on only a few regions. SO 2.4. Safeguarding the environment in central Europe The economic and environmental significance of natural assets and landscapes in central Europe calls for a co-ordinated valorisation and protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. There is a strong need to counteract negative effects of human action through integrated environmental management approaches. SO 2.5. Greening urban mobility in central Europe A reduction of transport emissions is one of the key targets of the European Green Deal. Smart and greener urban mobility will need an integrated response. Many functional urban areas in central Europe face similar challenges when greening their mobility. The specific territorial need lies in the vast diversity of topics (e.g. pollution and congestion) that need to be addressed in an integrated approach. Furthermore, the topic does not only include different ways of mobility, but also urban as well as urban-rural logistics. Priority 3: Cooperating for a better connected Europe SO 3.1. Improving transport connections of rural and peripheral regions in central Europe The programme area is a relevant junction in Europe. This can strategically facilitate the participation in trade and increase competitiveness. Accessibility to larger transport corridors is, however, comparatively weak. There is a need to link especially peripheral regions to the nodes of the TEN-T core network corridors (CNC), to remove bottlenecks and to bridge missing transport links in order to ensure good accessibility across central Europe. Furthermore, there is the need to reduce transport emissions by 90% by 2050, which calls for smart and sustainable approaches to cross-border mobility, intermodality and the introduction of IT-supported solutions for mobility management. Priority 4: Improving governance for cooperation in central Europe SO 4.1 Strengthening governance for integrated territorial development in central Europe Central Europe is highly heterogeneous both in territorial as well as in socio-economic terms. A multitude of challenges and barriers hinders the economic, social and territorial development in central Europe, which are not necessarily bound to specific administrative units. They rather relate to areas with functional ties that are characterised by economic, social, and environmental linkages. Addressing these territorial development challenges calls for integrated multi-level and multi-sectoral governance processes that consider functional linkages at the territorial level. There is a need to improve capacities of public authorities on all territorial levels for setting up and implementing integrated territorial development strategies. Cooperation should be encouraged within and between territories that are sharing functional ties. read more Expected effects and impacts Strategic projects for capitalisation are to take up existing Interreg transnational and cross-border outputs and results, to meet existing and new needs and strengthen their territorial and policy impact in wider areas, also beyond border regions. They must go beyond a mere pooling or duplication of what already exists. Instead, they should further develop, improve, or adapt existing outputs and results by drawing on the experience of more projects. These projects unlock synergies, strengthen networks, boost visibility and attract political attention, ensuring that successful ideas go further and reach wider. Above all, they must clearly show how they add value beyond what has already been achieved. Focus should be on quality over quantity, carefully selecting only the most relevant outputs and results to address specific challenges and needs. Capitalisation can be implemented in two different ways. Both approaches are complementary and a combination of the two in one strategic project for capitalisation is possible. Upstreaming: Existing outputs and results are taken up and tailored in a way that policy makers can address border issues through new or improved territorial or thematic policies and strategies. This should happen at the most appropriate level (i.e. European, national, regional or local). Downstreaming: Existing outputs and results are tailored in a way that they can be further rolled-out at the most appropriate level. Such roll-out could be “territorial” in case the adapted outputs and results are applied in other regions facing similar issues; or “sectoral” when the adapted outputs and results are applied to other sectors than the ones initially addressed. Given that strategic projects for capitalisation are to be regarded as “operations of strategic importance”, they shall comply with specific communication requirements set by the European Commission for these projects for ensuring high visibility and engagement. In addition to branding and visibility requirements outlined in chapter I.4.4.2 of the programme manual, projects shall: Organise at least one communication event involving the programme managing authority and representatives of the European Commission in a timely manner. Contribute to joint programme-level communication activities, such as events, campaigns, or thematic publications. Strategic projects for capitalisation will be closely monitored by the programme, examining their implementation progress and strategic contribution. read more Expected results Strategic projects for capitalisation can address all topics specified in chapter 2 of the Interreg Programme (IP) document for each programme specific objective (SO), without restrictions. Applicants are however, encouraged to consider in particular those thematic areas concerning the most significant central European territorial challenges as well as showing a higher potential to capitalise existing Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE and cross-border achievements. Some of thematic areas holding these characteristics are mentioned below for each programme priority (non-exhaustive list). Priority 1: Cooperating for a smarter Central Europe Explore the thematic areas existing projects under Priority 1 are addressing and identify potential synergies for your own project.
