    'short description This priority aims at supporting civil society organisations to prevent and combat all forms and manifestations of antisemitism, offline and online, in line with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, and at supporting civil society organisations to foster Jewish life. Call objectives European Jews have been contributing to the social, political, economic and cultural development of Europe and are an inextricable part of Europe’s identity. Following the 7 October terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israeli society and the war that ensued, antisemitism has risen across Europe and around the world. This escalation has created a climate of everyday “ambient antisemitism”, characterised by growing insecurity, isolation and the erosion of trust within Jewish communities. Today, we are witnessing a troubling rise in Holocaust distortion and the worrying conflation of the Shoah with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. This distortion has a corrosive impact on the resilience of our society and democracy. Antisemitism and polarization pose a threat not only to the Jewish communities but also to the broader European society and undermine democratic values Priority 2 is split into an open sub-priority and a restricted sub-priority in support of public authorities. Sub-priority 2.1 – open call: This open sub-priority will support projects that help to implement the EU Strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life (2021-2030). We are looking for projects that focus on: raising awareness on contemporary antisemitism and its impact on society in general, and on specific target groups such as multipliers (educators, journalists, policy makers) and raising awareness about Jewish life to counter antisemitism; improving the monitoring of antisemitic incidents, encouraging reporting and strengthening cooperation with the police at local level; strengthening leadership capacities within Jewish communities to counter antisemitism, especially by developing professional networks, thus contributing to fostering Jewish life; building bridges between Jewish and other minority groups in the common fight against intolerance and discrimination. This sub-priority does not support research projects. Projects can be either national or transnational. Transnational projects are particularly encouraged. We particularly encourage projects to have at least one Jewish civil society organisation, or an organisation specialised in fighting antisemitism, as one of the main partners. Projects led by Jewish civil society organisations are also strongly encouraged. Projects that promote partnerships based on the diversity of and tolerance among different groups and communities are also encouraged. Sub-priority 2.2 – restricted call in support of public authorities: This sub-priority aims at supporting public authorities to develop and implement their action plans on combating antisemitism. We are looking for projects that focus on: developing and/or implementing national action plans or strategies on combating antisemitism; improving the recording and reporting of antisemitic incidents and harmonising data collection in line with the Vienna Declaration; preventing and countering antisemitism, thus fostering Jewish life. This sub-priority does not support research projects. Projects can be either national or transnational. We encourage projects to have at least one Jewish civil society organisation, or an organisation specialised in fighting antisemitism, as one of the main partners. read more Expected effects and impacts Increased knowledge of EU and national non-discrimination legislation; Improved knowledge and application of administrative practices in the non-discrimination field, including practices and policies covering antisemitism; Empowered and increased protection for groups, communities and individuals affected by manifestations of antisemitism; Improved knowledge and awareness of and capacity to react to all forms of antisemitism among the population in general and key groups in particular such as decision-makers, law enforcement and the judiciary, and young people; Increased knowledge on the recording and the collection of data on incidents, with a view of harmonising the methodologies across the EU. More effective implementation and enforcement of the legislation on non-discrimination, as well as improved independent monitoring and reporting; Expected results Activities that can be funded under the open call: Coalition building, capacity building and training for professionals and victims of (intersectional) discrimination; Mutual learning, exchange of good practices, cooperation, including identifying best practices which may be transferable to other participating countries; Dissemination of information and awareness-raising, including via social media, press campaigns and through engaging with media industry; Data recording, data collection, surveys, monitoring and reporting of incidents of discrimination; Gender- and age-sensitive victim empowerment and support; Contributing to designing and implementing strategies or action plans. Priority will be given to practical projects that develop and implement specific measures and involve the target group. Activities that can be funded under the restricted call: Drafting, updating or implementing national action plans or strategies; Training law enforcement officials and/or authorities at national, regional or local level; Improving the collecting and processing of equality data in Member States, in particular building on the work of the Subgroup on equality data and the work of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights on equality data; Improving victim-sensitive support for victims of (intersectional) discrimination, in particular on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, religion or colour, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics, at national, regional or local level; Addressing underreporting; Building trust between communities and public authorities. All consortia are encouraged to produce English translations of the main project’s outputs to increase the possibility of best practice exchange and dissemination of the results across the EU. Activities that support specific political parties will not be funded, regardless of their grounds for applying or objectives. All activities should, both at design and implementation stage, incorporate a gender equality perspective. Thus, applicants are expected to conduct and include in their proposal a gender analysis (including non-binary people where applicable), which maps the potential different impact of the project and its activities on people in all their diversity. Applicants should demonstrate that they reflected on the equality dimension of their proposal and address it in a way that is proportionate to their project. Thereby, unintended negative effects of the intervention on any gender should be avoided (dono-harm approach). Applicants are encouraged to consult the key questions listed on the website of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) when conducting their gender analysis. A gender-sensitive approach should include identification of best practices, data collection, including disaggregated statistics, information dissemination and monitoring and evaluation approaches. All activities must avoid discrimination, victimisation and stereotyping. All applicants who need further guidance are advised to consult the EIGE’s materials on gender analysis and DG JUST’s online workshop on gender mainstreaming projects. Where applicable, applicants are advised to complement their gender analysis with an analysis of other grounds of discrimination that can have an impact on project implementation. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate a good understanding of intersectional discrimination when framing target group needs and reflect this in their proposal. Reflections should be proportionate to the project’s scope and context. read more',

    'short description Projects should promote diversity and inclusion at the workplace via an intersectional approach. Projects concerning one ground of discrimination are not the focus of this priority. Call objectives We are looking for projects that focus on: strengthening the Diversity Charters network, supporting the implementation and further development of existing Diversity Charters in the EU and increasing the number of their signatories. The priority does not support research projects or projects on skills development. Projects can be either national or transnational. Transnational projects are particularly encouraged. Applications from consortia bringing together different types of organisations are particularly encouraged. Expected effects and impacts Increased number of organisations affiliated to a Diversity Charter; Increased knowledge and awareness on the benefits of diversity and inclusion at the workplace; Increased diversity at the workplace, supported by stronger links between the academic and research community and the business world; More inclusive workplaces and societies; Increased and improved Europe-wide guidance and tools to build inclusive workplaces and to measure diversity and inclusion at the workplace. Expected results Activities that can be funded: Coalition building, capacity building and training for professionals and victims of (intersectional) discrimination; Mutual learning, exchange of good practices, cooperation, including identifying best practices which may be transferable to other participating countries; Dissemination of information and awareness-raising, including via social media, press campaigns and through engaging with media industry; Data recording, data collection, surveys, monitoring and reporting of incidents of discrimination; Gender- and age-sensitive victim empowerment and support; Contributing to designing and implementing strategies or action plans. All consortia are encouraged to produce English translations of the main project’s outputs to increase the possibility of best practice exchange and dissemination of the results across the EU. Activities that support specific political parties will not be funded, regardless of their grounds for applying or objectives. All activities should, both at design and implementation stage, incorporate a gender equality perspective. Thus, applicants are expected to conduct and include in their proposal a gender analysis (including non-binary people where applicable), which maps the potential different impact of the project and its activities on people in all their diversity. Applicants should demonstrate that they reflected on the equality dimension of their proposal and address it in a way that is proportionate to their project. Thereby, unintended negative effects of the intervention on any gender should be avoided (dono-harm approach). Applicants are encouraged to consult the key questions listed on the website of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) when conducting their gender analysis. A gender-sensitive approach should include identification of best practices, data collection, including disaggregated statistics, information dissemination and monitoring and evaluation approaches. All activities must avoid discrimination, victimisation and stereotyping. All applicants who need further guidance are advised to consult the EIGE’s materials on gender analysis and DG JUST’s online workshop on gender mainstreaming projects. Where applicable, applicants are advised to complement their gender analysis with an analysis of other grounds of discrimination that can have an impact on project implementation. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate a good understanding of intersectional discrimination when framing target group needs and reflect this in their proposal. Reflections should be proportionate to the project’s scope and context. read more',

Priority will be given to practical projects that develop and implement specific measures and involve the target group. All consortia are encouraged to produce English translations of the main project’s outputs to increase the possibility of best practice exchange and dissemination of the results across the EU. Activities that support specific political parties will not be funded, regardless of their grounds for applying or objectives. All activities should, both at design and implementation stage, incorporate a gender equality perspective. Thus, applicants are expected to conduct and include in their proposal a gender analysis (including non-binary people where applicable), which maps the potential different impact of the project and its activities on people in all their diversity. Applicants should demonstrate that they reflected on the equality dimension of their proposal and address it in a way that is proportionate to their project. Thereby, unintended negative effects of the intervention on any gender should be avoided (dono-harm approach). Applicants are encouraged to consult the key questions listed on the website of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) when conducting their gender analysis. A gender-sensitive approach should include identification of best practices, data collection, including disaggregated statistics, information dissemination and monitoring and evaluation approaches. All activities must avoid discrimination, victimisation and stereotyping. All applicants who need further guidance are advised to consult the EIGE’s materials on gender analysis and DG JUST’s online workshop on gender mainstreaming projects. Where applicable, applicants are advised to complement their gender analysis with an analysis of other grounds of discrimination that can have an impact on project implementation. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate a good understanding of intersectional discrimination when framing target group needs and reflect this in their proposal. Reflections should be proportionate to the project’s scope and context. read more',
