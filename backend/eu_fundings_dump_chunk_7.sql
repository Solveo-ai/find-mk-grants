      'short description Under this topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions for improving capabilities of practitioners in border surveillance and/or maritime security. External border areas, pre-frontier areas as well as contexts and scenarios in Europe’s border regions that may in the future be impacted by geopolitical instabilities, hybrid threats, or tensions from outside the EU, and need sustained and improved surveillance and reaction capabilities, could be particularly considered. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Effective Management of EU External Borders 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. Call objectives Proposals may address capabilities of information exchange, capabilities for detection of illegal activities, and/or solutions that can be deployed efficiently across diverse geographical regions; capabilities for operational event data recording; capabilities to detect irregular activities in areas of terminals for travel (air, sea) or logistics terminals around a Border Control Point, without disrupting the flow of operations; capabilities that support and help the decision-making process and facilitate operating in different scenarios (air, sea, land) simultaneously. The EBCG Capability Roadmap recognises that future surveillance capabilities that help detect cross-border irregularities and cases requiring Search and Rescue activities are essential. Solutions should be modular and scalable to cater to the regional and challenges specificities. Examples of technologies and solutions that may be relevant for this topic include but are not limited to: sensing (at tactical, operational, and/or strategic levels), autonomous platforms, vehicles and systems (aerial, ground, surface or underwater, vessel-based or not, mobile or land-borne, etc); interconnectivity between sensors and platforms and automated data fusion; data processing systems; image and signal processing and analysis; robotics; computing technologies including edge and cloud computing; decision-support systems and human-machine interfaces. Projects should integrate: perspectives of safeguarding and promoting human rights, including gender equality, developing solutions that contribute to those safeguarding and promotion; inputs from human rights, law and ethical perspectives, as well as the consideration and views of individuals and society, as well as a gender sensitive approach, as appropriate; proposals can engage with civil society organisations for wider input and support; aspects of cybersecurity of the technology proposed, and the protection of communication systems and networks involved in the solutions, if and as relevant. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals that include solutions and/or methods that would contribute to a lower environmental impact and footprint, better cost-efficiency, better energy-efficiency, and/or better operational autonomy of the capabilities and solutions in this topic, would be welcome. Depending on the particular scope of the proposal, participation of Police and/or Customs Authorities is welcome. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project. In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcome(s): Improved security of EU external borders, or of maritime environment, infrastructures and activities, against natural, accidental or incidental disasters; challenges such as illegal trafficking (covering air, maritime, underwater, land/surface), irregular migration or exceptional situations of mass arrivals at external borders, illegal exploitation of natural resources, piracy and potential terrorist attacks, cyber and hybrid threats; Sustained and improved surveillance, real-time situational awareness, and reaction capabilities to cope with potential critical situations at the EU external borders; Improved decision-making processes and capabilities for assessing, confirming and responding to distress situations at sea and land, allowing a better and faster response.',

University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipTo be eligible for funding, applicants must be established in one of the following countries: the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows: at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries. Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaSubject to restrictions for the protection of European communication networks. This topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least 2 Border or Coast Guard Authorities from at least 2 different EU Member States or Associated Countries. For these participants, applicants must application form with all the requested information, following the template provided in the submission IT tool. If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may additionally be used).',

      'short description Under this open topic, proposals are invited to address new challenges, and/or develop innovative solutions to existing challenges in order to increase the resilience of critical infrastructure. Call objectives Proposals should primarily address sector(s) and/or interdependencies that are not covered, in particular by the past Horizon Europe calls: Resilient Infrastructure 2023 and Resilient Infrastructure 2024. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Resilient Infrastructure 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on their outcomes and not duplicate them. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed activities, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstrations, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Proposals should also outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at regional, national and/or EU level. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes. In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. Proposals should plan their activities opting for the financial support to third parties in order to provide financial support to practitioners (critical infrastructure operator, government authority responsible for infrastructure resilience, national authority responsible for overseeing critical infrastructure operators, or civil protection authority) for expanding the proposed work in terms of additional user groups, complementary assessments, technology- or methodology-testing activities and/or to SMEs as additional solution providers. From 10% up to 30% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals must clearly describe the objectives and the expected results to be obtained, including the elements listed in the application template. Proposals are also expected to describe the methods and processes relevant to comply with the general eligibility conditions for financial support to third parties set out in General Annex B and to demonstrate effectiveness (impact). Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication, exploit complementarities, and use opportunities for increased impact. Similarly, coordination with projects funded under HORIZON-CL3-2025-INFRA-01-02: Open topic for role of the human factor for resilience of European critical entities. Expected results Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Critical infrastructure is more resilient to natural hazards, intentional and accidental harmful human actions, including cyberattacks; Critical infrastructure operators and authorities have better mapping of the interdependencies relevant for the addressed sector(s) also in view of better managing potential multi-hazard, cross-sectorial and cross border crisis; Critical infrastructure operators and authorities have access to improved monitoring, risk and threat assessment, forecast, and if applicable modelling tools as well as cyber- and physical security solutions; Critical infrastructure operators and authorities have access to increased post-incident investigation capabilities contributing to better crisis prevention, preparedness, management and response; Effective digital tools to conduct virtual and physical stress tests are available for relevant security practitioners; Training curricula for critical infrastructure operators, authorities and/or first responders are developed. read more',

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipTo be eligible for funding, applicants must be established in one of the following countries: the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows: at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries. Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaSubject to restrictions for the protection of European communication networks. This topic requires involvement as beneficiaries of at least 3 relevant practitioners from at least 3 different EU Member States or Associated Countries. Depending on the specific proposal submitted, these practitioners should represent one or several of the following portfolios: critical infrastructure operator, authority responsible for critical infrastructure resilience, civil protection authority, law enforcement or private companies delivering security for critical infrastructure. The scale of operation of the above practitioners (national, regional or local) should match the proposal objectives. For these participants, applicants must fill in the table “Information about security practitioners” in the application form with all requested information. If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may additionally be used).',

      'short description The underlying idea of this topic is to avoid that security and disaster risk research projects obtain and prepare data that at the end of the projects is simply lost instead of being stored and shared for reuse. Call objectives In the security domain, due to its specificities, the special categories of data involved or/and unique limitations, which may call for additional requirements, a consolidated, common research database is particularly desired. It is of utmost importance that security practitioners are provided with an increased interoperability and improved (cross-border) exchange of data thanks to harmonised data file formats across Europe, which would easily take into account technological evolutions, i.e., be adaptable in time. Such a lack of realistic, up-to-date and sufficient training and testing data for research purposes and consequently the need for a database, data repository or any other effective and useful tool(s) to gather, manage and store varying security research data, have been regularly raised by the projects working in the area of security. The same is true of data on disaster risk management where national or regional analysis and forecasting databases or national disaster risk assessments can be fragmented or sealed without reasonable open, sustainable access to the wider community. As a follow up of the outcomes and results of the LAGO project coming from the 2021 data topic: HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-04: Improved access to fighting crime and terrorism research data, the successful proposal, should subsequently focus on creation and deployment of a fully functional and operational common research data repository, which will extend to cover other security research areas. The LAGO project is currently developing the skeleton of how such a repository of R&I data should be created, by providing a detailed roadmap consisting of a clear set of rules, conditions and characteristics that such a consolidated database should have. This LAGO roadmap will provide technical, legal and ethical requirements for a training and testing research data repository mostly in the area of fighting crime and terrorism, but the same project will already take into account possible applications of identified solutions in different security research domains, such as infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience. The LAGO roadmap will also assess if the repository should be centralised or distributed, how to deal with "aging" data, how efficiently projects should exchange data among them taking into account security R&I specificities. Building on the skeleton of LAGO, the newly developed data repository will enable security community (researchers, practitioners, industry, policy makers) access the scientifically satisfactory amount of up-to-date high quality and realistic data which is or was used to develop reliable (mostly digital and based on AI but also non-digital and not linked with big data) tools, technologies and solutions in support of security research and innovation. This data repository could also be very useful for verification and validation of new innovative security solutions developed under various calls in the most recent Work Programme. Taking into account the complexity of the future repository, a multi-faceted approach will be needed and the proposal, apart from the roadmap’s findings developed by LAGO, should also build on, and not duplicate, LAGO’s outcomes regarding the following aspects: What exact types of data should be stored in the repository; Interoperability with existing operational systems; Interoperability/compatibility with European open science cloud (EOSC), with the TESSERA project as well as other potentially relevant architectures and initiatives such as European Data Spaces or GAIA-X; How to search for data; Data models for security research - Harmonising of data formats; Concept of operations for the use of the repository by/during EU-funded security R&I projects, modalities of use, user profiles/schemes, etc. Legal issues, avoidance of any bias, accessibility levels related to the sensitivity of various data sets, solutions for annotation as well as for the aging of the data, etc. read more Expected effects and impacts The proposal should carry out extensive testing and evaluation (verification and validation), in close cooperation with ongoing projects, which would access the repository, populate it and use data intensively during the project implementation. The proposal should develop an exploitation and sustainability plan following up the planning activities of LAGO, including funding instruments to be used for the operationalisation of the repository developed under the project as well as finding possibilities to maintain the repository after the lifetime of the project so that it not only continues to well function but is able to be extended with new data. The data repository will need to grow so it will have to be treated as an ongoing system. Co-ordination with already existing platforms or communities already using another reliable domain-specific data repository/ies for archiving and sharing research data is strongly recommended in order to verify if it would be possible to adhere in the future to a larger system or infrastructure of repositories such as European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) for example and other relevant activities. Adopting sound security practices, such as developing comprehensive access rules to allow only authorized users with a legitimate need to access, modify, or transmit data, are crucial. Combined with a digital signature approach or multi-factor authentication, access rules go a long way in keeping sensitive data stored in a data repository secure. These and other security measures, such as the anonymisation of personal data, will enable the research community to fully leverage large volumes of data without introducing unnecessary security risks. The repository developed by the proposal should preserve research data relevant to various security research domains, such as fighting crime and terrorism, infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience across time and help security research community easily find, access and re-use the necessary data. The development and the functioning of the repository will be based on the outcomes of the roadmap from the LAGO project from 2021 FCT call project within the remits of Horizon Europe regulation (including ethics). The repository should be operational to be tested for at least one year before the project ends. Data sharing will be based on open science principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). To make data FAIR, the basics of good Research Data Management will have to be applied. All necessary system features as well as the functioning of the repository should comply with privacy and data protection requirements when handling data, in order to facilitate data management ensuring full access to the data actually needed (in line with the necessity and proportionality principle and in full respect of fundamental rights and applicable legislation. Projects should take into account, during their lifetime, relevant activities and initiatives for ensuring and improving the quality of scientific software and code, such as those resulting from projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02 on the development of community-based approaches.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

      'short description Societal resilience and preparedness to disasters are shaped by the way authorities and citizens exchange, access, understand, and react to information about hazards. As a result, anyone may become more vulnerable if barriers to these processes occur. Call objectives Strengthening societal resilience to disasters requires investment by authorities at operational, strategic, and policy levels to improve engagement with citizens and integrate inclusive communication processes. In order to achieve this, it is important to take into account the diversity of citizens, be it relating to age, gender, educational levels, disability, and other social characteristics. The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The EU’s disaster resilience goal No. 2 is “Prepare – Increasing risk awareness and preparedness of the population. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting these two policies and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Proposals are invited to utilise the Special Eurobarometer on “Disaster risk awareness and preparedness of the EU population" as evidence of needs. Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions and technology, including the use of AI, for improving disaster preparedness, risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities, and for reinforcing the cooperation among scientific / technical communities and policy-makers / regional and/or local authorities for an enhanced sharing of knowledge and uptake of research outputs. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. Proposals are expected to address one of the following options: Option a: Tools and solutions to improve disaster preparedness and risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities; Option b: Mechanism to enhance dialogue among research/academic communities, practitioners and regional and/or local authorities for sharing knowledge and effectively uptake research results. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage with citizen organisations, regional and/or local authorities and practitioners (first and second responders/civil protection agencies/disaster management authorities), private sector operators during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the Disaster Risk Reduction community. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities.
