      'short description The call invites organisations from across central Europe to submit transnational cooperation ideas for strategic projects for capitalisation, using the potential to team up efforts between cross-border and transnational projects, strengthening the impact of Interreg as a whole for the benefit of the central Europe area. The overall objective of the call is to reduce the effects of borders on flows and functional linkages among central European regions, for a more competitive and resilient central Europe. Call objectives The programme mission is to bring regions and cities together beyond borders to find fitting solutions for their citizens – in a fair and equal way everywhere. It encourages and supports transnational cooperation to make regions more resilient to common challenges that know no borders and which cannot be solved alone. These challenges include among others economic transition processes, climate change, and the long-term socioeconomic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. The programme priorities and specific objectives form the backbone of the Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE funding strategy in 2021-27. In line with the thematic fields, transnational cooperation actions are expected to address the development and implementation of strategies, action plans, tools, training, pilot actions and related solutions. All actions will have to respect the horizontal principles of sustainable development including environmental protection as well as equal opportunities, non-discrimination and gender equality. Priority 1: Cooperating for a smarter central Europe SO 1.1 Strengthening innovation capacities in central Europe Strong innovation capacities bear enormous relevance for central Europe considering its strong industrial base and the importance of sectors such as agriculture and food, or tourism. Innovation is also central for strengthening central Europe’s economic resilience. Capacities for innovation need to be fostered especially in regions that are struggling with the transition to a more globalised, digitalised and green economy. Knowledge and technology transfer, especially for SMEs, is a critical need. SO 1.2 Strenghtening skills for smart specialisation, industrial transition and entrepreneurship in central Europe The strong industrial base of central Europe and its dependence on adequate skills underlines the strategic relevance of this specific objective. SMEs have been identified as the main providers of employment in central Europe and it is important to foster locally available human skills, especially for the transition to Industry 4.0, digitalisation and a green economy. Capacities for an efficient entrepreneurial discovery process need to be improved as well as for the preparation or updating of smart specialisation strategies. Place-based development of skills is also crucial for reducing urban-rural disparities. Overall, there is the need for a just transition process that is socially responsible. Priority 2: Cooperating for a greener central Europe SO 2.1 Supporting the energy transition to a climate-neutral central Europe Central Europe needs to speed up its performance related both to energy efficiency as well as the production and use of renewable energy to meet EU targets and climate objectives of the European Green Deal. Significant regional disparities between central European regions have to be tackled. Energy efficiency and renewable energy need to be promoted and exploited to reach a wider geographical coverage. SO 2.2. Increasing the resilience to climate change risks in central Europe Resilience to climate change risks represents an important need for central Europe, especially in view of its significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. A specific territorial aspect is the need for integrated and cross-sectoral approaches to best adapt to climate change. In order to build up climate resilience, general approaches need to be locally adapted towards workable and manageable, integrated solutions which can be proliferated across the entire central Europe area. SO 2.3. Taking circular economy forward in central Europe A climate-neutral, resource-efficient and competitive economy requires up-scaled circular approaches. This economic transformation has to pay attention to the fact that a circular economy will often require a re- arrangement of value chains, changes of interdependencies and the creation of new profit options. It is important that this socio-economic transformation happens across the entire territory of central Europe and does not concentrate on only a few regions. SO 2.4. Safeguarding the environment in central Europe The economic and environmental significance of natural assets and landscapes in central Europe calls for a co-ordinated valorisation and protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. There is a strong need to counteract negative effects of human action through integrated environmental management approaches. SO 2.5. Greening urban mobility in central Europe A reduction of transport emissions is one of the key targets of the European Green Deal. Smart and greener urban mobility will need an integrated response. Many functional urban areas in central Europe face similar challenges when greening their mobility. The specific territorial need lies in the vast diversity of topics (e.g. pollution and congestion) that need to be addressed in an integrated approach. Furthermore, the topic does not only include different ways of mobility, but also urban as well as urban-rural logistics. Priority 3: Cooperating for a better connected Europe SO 3.1. Improving transport connections of rural and peripheral regions in central Europe The programme area is a relevant junction in Europe. This can strategically facilitate the participation in trade and increase competitiveness. Accessibility to larger transport corridors is, however, comparatively weak. There is a need to link especially peripheral regions to the nodes of the TEN-T core network corridors (CNC), to remove bottlenecks and to bridge missing transport links in order to ensure good accessibility across central Europe. Furthermore, there is the need to reduce transport emissions by 90% by 2050, which calls for smart and sustainable approaches to cross-border mobility, intermodality and the introduction of IT-supported solutions for mobility management. Priority 4: Improving governance for cooperation in central Europe SO 4.1 Strengthening governance for integrated territorial development in central Europe Central Europe is highly heterogeneous both in territorial as well as in socio-economic terms. A multitude of challenges and barriers hinders the economic, social and territorial development in central Europe, which are not necessarily bound to specific administrative units. They rather relate to areas with functional ties that are characterised by economic, social, and environmental linkages. Addressing these territorial development challenges calls for integrated multi-level and multi-sectoral governance processes that consider functional linkages at the territorial level. There is a need to improve capacities of public authorities on all territorial levels for setting up and implementing integrated territorial development strategies. Cooperation should be encouraged within and between territories that are sharing functional ties. read more Expected effects and impacts Strategic projects for capitalisation are to take up existing Interreg transnational and cross-border outputs and results, to meet existing and new needs and strengthen their territorial and policy impact in wider areas, also beyond border regions. They must go beyond a mere pooling or duplication of what already exists. Instead, they should further develop, improve, or adapt existing outputs and results by drawing on the experience of more projects. These projects unlock synergies, strengthen networks, boost visibility and attract political attention, ensuring that successful ideas go further and reach wider. Above all, they must clearly show how they add value beyond what has already been achieved. Focus should be on quality over quantity, carefully selecting only the most relevant outputs and results to address specific challenges and needs. Capitalisation can be implemented in two different ways. Both approaches are complementary and a combination of the two in one strategic project for capitalisation is possible. Upstreaming: Existing outputs and results are taken up and tailored in a way that policy makers can address border issues through new or improved territorial or thematic policies and strategies. This should happen at the most appropriate level (i.e. European, national, regional or local). Downstreaming: Existing outputs and results are tailored in a way that they can be further rolled-out at the most appropriate level. Such roll-out could be “territorial” in case the adapted outputs and results are applied in other regions facing similar issues; or “sectoral” when the adapted outputs and results are applied to other sectors than the ones initially addressed. Given that strategic projects for capitalisation are to be regarded as “operations of strategic importance”, they shall comply with specific communication requirements set by the European Commission for these projects for ensuring high visibility and engagement. In addition to branding and visibility requirements outlined in chapter I.4.4.2 of the programme manual, projects shall: Organise at least one communication event involving the programme managing authority and representatives of the European Commission in a timely manner. Contribute to joint programme-level communication activities, such as events, campaigns, or thematic publications. Strategic projects for capitalisation will be closely monitored by the programme, examining their implementation progress and strategic contribution. read more Expected results Strategic projects for capitalisation can address all topics specified in chapter 2 of the Interreg Programme (IP) document for each programme specific objective (SO), without restrictions. Applicants are however, encouraged to consider in particular those thematic areas concerning the most significant central European territorial challenges as well as showing a higher potential to capitalise existing Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE and cross-border achievements.
