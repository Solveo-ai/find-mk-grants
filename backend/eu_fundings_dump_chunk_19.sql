      'short description The share of trips made by active modes is increasing, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This increase is linked to cities actively placing more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved infrastructure. Call objectives Pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities. Proposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects: Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions; Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users; Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight; Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles; Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles; Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a draft European regulatory framework on the type-approval of micromobility vehicles or self-certification based on harmonised standards; Identify, define and pilot test the following in at least two clearly identified real-life urban environments: new geometric designs of infrastructure to ensure safe, seamless, and comfortable mobility for pedestrians, cyclists and users of micromobility modes while accounting for the increasing demand, higher operating speeds and weight and size of e-bikes, e-scooters and all types of micromobility devices; smart technologies (V2X) to assess their effectiveness in preventing and decreasing conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility modes users and motorised traffic; road safety requisites, requirements, rules and/or regulations that could be put in place by local authorities in order to increase the take-up and the safety of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups, by 20% compared to the baseline at the start of the project; development of a comprehensive, real-time information platform for cyclists that includes data on route accessibility, signage, and infrastructure conditions. Special focus should be paid to supporting the safety of user groups with particular vulnerability including people with disabilities (physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, sensory, etc). read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals are invited to explain how the work supports local/regional/national authorities’ efforts to deliver on the objectives of the Vision Zero Strategy, the Strategic Action Plan on Road Safety and the EU Road Safety Policy Framework 2021-2030 as well as on the integration of road safety policies and programmes in Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning. Proposals should plan for an active collaboration with the well-recognised initiatives in the field of road safety and urban mobility such as the European Road Safety Observatory and the CIVITAS initiative. In addition, proposals should demonstrate that the proposed approaches build upon the results from previous research actions and liaise and collaborate with the projects that will be selected under topic “HORIZON-MISS-2025-06-CIT-CANCER-01: Walking and cycling: increasing their modal share to reap health benefits and emission reductions and integrating active mobility and micro-mobility devices, with smart technologies and infrastructure”. This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions, as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities, with a focus on human-technology interaction, responsiveness of safety solutions and how this varies across different population groups, and behavioural norms. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes: Improved (compared to the current figures for the locations selected for the pilot testing) road safety (actual and perceived) for pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility devices, considering that the safety of these users is not only at risk from motorised vehicles, but also from their interaction with road users with higher masses or operating speeds (e.g. between e-bikes and pedestrians); An in-depth analysis and assessment of the safety associated with the emergence of electrically assisted small vehicles such e-bikes, e-cargo bikes, e-scooters, to be referred to as micromobility modes, that may be shared or own, and are used for personal mobility (e.g. commuting) and the transportation of goods (e.g. parcel delivery); Increased (compared to the current figures for the locations selected for the pilot testing) use of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups as a result of improved safety; Standardisation guidelines for the authorities (cities authorities, police, and hospitals) on how to report crashes that involve micromobility modes with the objective to avoid under- and/or misreporting; Guidelines for the city authorities on how to incorporate micromobility modes in their Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and account for the safety and convenience of all road users; Development of mitigating solutions for the adverse impact on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians, and other users of the changing car fleet towards bigger and heavier vehicles; In depth analysis of the impact of road infrastructure (e.g. design, markings, degradation status, quality, network connectivity) on the safety and comfort of cyclists, pedestrians, and micromobility users and development of mitigation solutions; Assessment methodologies to evaluate the safety potential and the effectiveness of advanced safety measures. read more',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

      'short description The initial deployment of Level 4 automated vehicle services in urban and other complex settings has encountered significant challenges in environmental perception and decision-making, leading to occasional remote assistance calls, blockages and accidents that have impacted public trust. At the same time, the increasing computing power demand is in conflict with a limited usage of energy and resources to meet sustainability requirements. Call objectives Emerging large-scale demonstrations of automated vehicles should be accompanied by objective-oriented research aimed at addressing these challenges directly, while targeting improvements in performance, accuracy, reliability, and cyber-security. To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects: Advancements in all steps of the sense-control-act process for both vehicle- and infrastructure-based smart sensor systems and networks, controllers, and actuators to ensure safety and trustworthiness of CCAM, as well as facilitating effective disruption management; Utilisation of digital enabling technologies including, for example: AI at-the-edge, machine learning, data spaces with reference scenarios and suitable software architectures; Adoption of modular, reusable, and open software platforms supporting the environment perception for CCAM while ensuring transparency of operation, verification, and safety assessment to build trust, with respect to authorities, decision makers and the public via direct performance explainability; Energy efficiency, circularity, and eco-design of the environment perception systems by decreasing potential energy and resource consumption in both production and operation as well as facilitating reusability, reparability and upgradability while further enhancing the performance; Reduction of potential costs of environment perception systems through scalability, modularity and standardisation, making technologies financially viable for widespread implementation; Support remote assistance as a stepping-stone towards higher levels of autonomy and vehicle automation in wider Operational Design Domains (ODD). read more Expected effects and impacts Solutions are expected to integrate electronic hardware architectures and software stacks in a co-design approach. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that solutions use, as far as possible, building blocks and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, e.g., on the hardware abstraction layer and SDV middleware and API framework. Results from projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-04 and complementarities with projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” should also be considered, where appropriate. As the activities should demonstrate feasibility and their full potential for real-world applications, proposals should foresee exchanges with other relevant EU or national projects for e.g., coordinated validation, transport systems integration and large-scale piloting. Collaboration should also be sought with projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-01 and other directly relevant call topics. In view of the relevance of environment perception and decision-making of automated vehicles for the responsiveness of the innovation to diverse societal interests and concerns, accessibility, inclusiveness as well as regulation, proposals should consider societal, ethical, socio-economical and/ or legal aspects as far as feasible in the requirements of the technical solutions to be developed. This could involve the engagement of institutional users as well as citizen-science approaches, e.g., in collaboration with projects CulturalRoad and Diversify – CCAM. To achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is highly relevant, considering the lessons learned in this area (for example, from robo-taxi and freight transport trials in the US and China). Activities should foster links between the European ecosystem and relevant stakeholders around the world, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries, while taking into account the legal, cultural, historical, and social aspects in Europe as well as other specificities of the European road network and cities (including: traffic rules, user behaviour, diverse user groups considering gender, age, disability, socio-economic status, streets morphology, and the structure and condition of roads in rural areas). This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: Availability of validated prototypes of next-generation vehicle and infrastructure-based environment perception technologies for robust, reliable and trustworthy CCAM operations to anticipate and avoid foreseeable risks and unexpected safety-critical situations in complex real-world conditions (e.g., at pedestrian crossings, in construction sites, during interactions with emergency vehicles, etc.); Understanding the degree (and limits) to which automated CCAM perception systems can anticipate, process, and respond to on-site ‘early-warnings’ (e.g., street design, sounds, smells and other signals from the environment, weather conditions, intentions of pedestrians, cyclists, and other active mobility users, etc.); Improvement of the energy-efficiency of the sense-think-act systems of CCAM considering the vehicle, the infrastructure, the cloud at-the-edge, while at the same time increasing the performance to guarantee security and error-free reliability; these developments will contribute to the reduction of the potential climate and environmental footprints of CCAM systems; Standardisation and adoption of modular, reusable, and upgradable software and hardware platforms, investigating scalable deployment concepts that lead to cost reduction and improved affordability while adopting a circular, eco-design approach (including efficient materials use, reduced waste, and the repair and reuse of components where feasible). read more',

      'short description Data sharing plays a pivotal role in supporting R&I, enabling deployment, and enhancing the competitiveness of the CCAM industry. Within the realm of data sharing, there are two distinct categories of data that are particularly pertinent: mobility data, and data for research and development. Call objectives The common European mobility data space aims to facilitate mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, including trustworthy AI integration). Several data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&I initiatives. The FAME project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&I projects. Several CCAM Partnership R&I projects expressed interest in making data available and reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE and SYNERGIES. However, this integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and governed by the Data Space Support Centre. In parallel, the DeployEMDS builds a decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe. Consequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena and AWARE2ALL have generated valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks. By establishing robust interfaces, ontologies, and data management architectures, the CCAM research community and industry can effectively utilise and repurpose existing data, thereby reducing costs, and facilitating the development and validation of CCAM solutions, including the creation of digital twins through synthetic data. The enhanced sharing of data across the CCAM stakeholders should also benefit national authorities, and operators in their efforts to collect KPIs to monitor wider impacts of CCAM solutions including on safety, economy, and society. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects: Identify how to further evolve the data spaces for CCAM applications, connecting existing dataspaces and bridging data gaps; Identify harmonisation and standardisation needs for taxonomies, interfaces, and data formats to push CCAM data exchange and extend and implement the CCAM taxonomies in the CCAM Test Data Space; Identify information needs and reference data for KPIs collected from Member States and Associated Countries (where relevant and to the extent possible) of i.e. high-level socio-economic statistics, accidents, infrastructure, vehicles; Establish a Federated CCAM Data Exchange Platform with tools and governance, including a viable business model to ensure the durability of the platform, which facilitates sharing of data for industry, social partners, authorities and academia that are supporting specific use cases related to: large-scale demonstrations, generation and maintenance of digital twins and representation of scenarios (for development or validation), performance and safety assessment, driver behaviour data from real and synthetic driving conditions, ADS regulation monitoring, AI model training, and common information source for national/EU level statistics and Key Performance Indicators; Identify and describe methods/algorithms/processes to refine and use data for the specific use cases tackled by the Platform; Identify the effects of the EU General Data Protection Legislation (GDPR) on AI learning workflows and possible mitigation measures. A strong alignment with the common European mobility data space and related projects is expected. The work should ensure coherence and interoperability with other common European data spaces, especially regarding its cross-sectoral blueprint and building blocks, by aligning with the Data Spaces Support Centre and by using, as far as possible, the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl. The work should build on the outcomes of the FAME project and the FAME Test Data Space (Data Sharing - Connected Automated Driving). Finally, links with related activities under the future European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC) for Mobility and Logistics Data and cooperation with the CCAM Partnership’s States Representative Group (SRG) is expected. Particular attention should be dedicated towards establishing interoperability standards for data sharing within and across data ecosystems, through the implementation of the FAIR data principles and leveraging already adopted practices, especially in relevant European common data spaces. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

      'short description CCAM-enabled vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings on road conditions, location, nearby vehicles and infrastructure. Such data is shared in real-time, while data from other sources is received. This needs powerful and optimised large data processing algorithms, which requires large amounts of computing power, data processing, real-time operation and high levels of security. Call objectives Most existing AI computing tasks for automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware. To encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential. Complementarities with projects funded under Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative. Edge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are essential in safety-critical situations. To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: For next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and complex AI models. Thus, it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM and AIthena. Develop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from projects such as SYNERGIES. The development and demonstration use case should include in-vehicle perception and understanding, such as object detection, segmentation, road surface tracking, sign and signal recognition, etc. Decision making and actuation of countermeasures is to be part of the chain of actions. The approaches for these building blocks and enabling technologies should facilitate a quick uptake in adjacent or following projects; Optimisation of the models for edge deployment. This involves adjusting the size and complexity of models to allow it to run on the relevant edge devices and include training and verification approaches. Techniques such as model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can be used to reduce the size of AI models without significant loss in performance. Additionally, over-the-air (OTA) updates can be used to manage and update models across a fleet of devices efficiently; Develop tools and approaches for edge-AI model monitoring, to ensure that edge-AI systems continue to operate as expected and ensure resilience to failure conditions or attacks, and monitoring model outputs to ensure they are accurate even as real-life conditions and datasets change. read more Expected effects and impacts The research will require due consideration of cyber security, connectivity and both personal and non-personal data protection rules, including compliance with the GDPR, and ensure that gender and other social categories (such as but not limited to disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic or racial origin, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections are duly considered where appropriate, as well as Explainable AI to enhance trust and regulatory compliance including alignment with the AI Act. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies in edge AI approaches for mobility and for CCAM, as well as its integration into the vehicle architecture. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

      'short description Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport represent around 25% of total man-made GHG emissions and continue to grow. The negative impact of these is further strengthened by the existence of other external costs of transport, including air pollution, noise, congestion and accidents. The EU, Member States and industry have made considerable efforts to reduce transport-related GHG emissions and associated external costs. Call objectives Accurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through: Regulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime), Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation), Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU MRV) and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU), and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive); Relevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” (COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting & Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions in Transport” (CLEVER); Standardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards; Regular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport; Industry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global logistics sector. Building on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure that: The full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and consistent way; Relevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically clarified and closed; Any detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU framework; New technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in developing datasets and methodologies; Relevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information. The Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services. read more Expected effects and impacts The proposals should address all of the following aspects: Explore, assess and establish the state of the art regarding issues of measuring and calculating specific types of transport-related emissions for which there is no clear consensus on the market, in particular: black carbon emissions, which primarily result from the combustion of fossil fuels in compression ignition engines; radiative forcing, which has been suggested as having a strong supplementary climate impact at high altitude and is already included in an inconsistent manner across some, but not all, transport GHG reporting programs; GHG emissions from vehicle manufacturing and scrappage, which, although not directly linked to transport operations, do contribute to overall life cycle transport emissions; GHG emissions that result from the installation of transport infrastructure, which would need to include the definition of rules for the combination of operational and life cycle emission calculations into a meaningful and consistent presentation format; GHG emissions related to the maintenance operations associated with transport operations that are currently excluded; GHG emissions from information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and data servers that support the delivery of transport operations. Clarify specific methodological issues for enabling more accurate quantification of emissions and setting proper incentives towards efficient and sustainable transport options, addressing in particular: a detailed methodology for GHG emissions stemming from temperature-controlled transport and cool chain operations; allocation of GHG air transport emissions across passengers and freight transported on the same aircraft.

Mechanisms to ensure coordination between other ongoing or selected projects (e.g. CLEVER) during their implementation should be put in place where applicable. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes: Input is provided for the implementation of the existing and forthcoming Union’s regulatory initiatives related to measurement, calculation and reporting of emissions in transport, such as Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime), Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation), and the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU); Methodological components are developed and proposed to complement the methodology for accounting emissions provided under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU.',

University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipTo be eligible for funding, applicants must be established in one of the following countries: the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows: at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries. Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',
