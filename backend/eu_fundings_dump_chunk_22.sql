      'short description Effective smart planning, operation and control of the electricity grid and numerous distributed devices – including smart electricity meters, smart bi-directional charging networks for electric vehicles, and smart building platforms – are essential. These efforts must be underpinned by markets for flexibility and demand response, along with seamless data exchange between actors and devices. Call objectives To achieve the Green Deal objectives for 2030 and 2050, substantial investments are required in a smart and digitally enabled energy system capable of integrating higher shares of renewable energy and electrification of demand and electricity storage. This encompasses various sectors such as transport (notably electric vehicles), industry (heating and hydrogen production) and residential heating. On-going innovation in the energy data space, smart Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, and digital twins for energy systems, coupled with energy price and market considerations, provide the foundation for advanced energy system intelligence. This intelligence will be further enhanced by leveraging generative artificial intelligence and the emerging AI Factories. The scope is to develop and pilot prototypes of a generative AI-powered digital spine that enhances the digitalisation and decarbonisation of the EU energy system. The overall scope is the development of a prototype of an automated, AI-powered, software-defined smart energy system leveraging and further developing existing (open-source) digital solutions of lower TRLs developed in EU and national research, innovation- and deployment-programmes, as well as AI algorithms and tools provided by the AI Factories, namely to: Develop and test the potential for generative AI to develop apps/programmes for local system optimisation and for system planning and operation; Develop and test generative AI that can identify sources of flexibility and provide solutions for interoperability and data exchange to enable decentralised optimisation of distributed assets. This includes the integration with various data sources and sectors, such as mobility, to promote decentralisation, energy-efficiency, and cost-efficiency and to enable interoperability across different parts of the energy system; Explore the potential of generative AI for system optimisation through scenario generation, simulation, and time series forecasting, while also developing optimisation tools for both supply-side and demand-side management using forecasts and data for renewable energy, transmission assets, storage, and energy-saving applications for consumers; Propose tools and control systems to apply generative AI solutions developed in a high-risk use-case (as defined in the AI act). The developed solutions should be dynamic, flexible, offering reconfigurable automated management, control and data exchange to ensure seamless operations across decentralised a setting. read more Expected effects and impacts Projects are expected to: Demonstrate AI-powered energy services, tools for power system planning and operation, and smart grid functionalities, such as flexibility, and electric vehicle (EV) charging as well as possibly transmission system operation across at least three EU member states and/or associated countries to enhance demand flexibility and drive innovative capabilities for decarbonisation and energy efficiency; Indicate which generative AI basic tools, including available tools from the AI Factories, will be used and demonstrate how energy sector users will be involved in the development and the testing (and possible uptake) of the generative AI tools by the project; Indicate what types of assets and what data sources will be used and involved in the project; Involve both traditional energy stakeholders and new entrants, such as energy service companies, aggregators, digital infrastructure providers, system integrators, energy asset manufacturers, energy communities, and active consumers; Leverage relevant European and international standards and technical specifications, and actively engage with standards development organisations; Contribute to the BRIDGE initiative, actively participate in its activities; Make use of the AI Factories and solutions, open-source where relevant, building on developments in previous Horizon Europe projects, particularly those related to flexibility markets and data exchange, Internet of Things and edge-cloud computing, adhering to relevant standards and engaging with standards development organisations to further develop these standards; Demonstrate how the new solutions can be integrated into and/or replace (parts of) existing legacy systems, including (for projects that focus on DSOs) demonstrate how the new solutions can integrate core functions of grid operations including SCADA systems functionality; Jointly provide a diverse set of applications of generative AI. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Availability of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for electricity system operators, energy service providers, and households and energy communities to enhance digital and green transformation in energy, mobility, and buildings; Implementation of decentralised IT solutions based on generative AI to support local grid optimisation, thereby increasing the uptake of renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and electrification of household and industrial demand at the distribution level; Increased reliability, resilience, security, and energy efficiency of the energy system through advanced AI and digital tools; Enhanced knowledge for modernising and operating energy networks, integrating digital services, renewables, and electrification through the use of cutting-edge AI technologies; Development of smarter demand-side tools for industries and consumers, leveraging AI to optimise energy production and consumption. read more',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons.

International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.

Call objectives The degradation rate might vary depending on many factors such as material properties, environmental stress (solar irradiance, humidity, temperature, wind speed, dust, etc.), installation, design and type of components and connections, with some components deteriorating on their own and others impacting additional PV components, leading to more severe failures. To tackle these issues and extend the lifetime of PV modules (and systems) proposals are expected to: Identify defects and failure modes encountered in recently developed high-efficiency or novel design c-silicon modules themselves and their components, exploring their mechanisms and root causes, reviewing each component’s susceptibility to defects and failures and impacting additional PV components; Develop, where necessary, simple, cost-effective and accurate module defect detection techniques (including through Artificial Intelligence (AI)), applicable to most PV modules and systems; Propose mitigation approaches at module and system level and validate approaches through modelling and/or AI modelling and lab testing; Perform outdoor field experiments and testing to determine degradation rates and/or to identify defects and failure modes and estimate service lifetime. Different locations representing the European range of climates are to be considered for field experiments. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV).

There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. However, abnormal degradation rates are still reported for cell and module technologies due to a variety of failures which reduce reliability and increase the cost of PV systems operation. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Reduced degradation to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes; Increased module durability and reliability; Resource efficiency and lifelong energy yield improvement of PV systems; Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE); Execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. read more',

Call objectives Projects are expected to: Demonstrate the integration of power electronics, intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), and software solutions in the distribution substations or in their proximity; Demonstrate real-time monitoring and analysis of grid conditions (including power quality, voltage levels, grid component monitoring, and overall system performance) that allow operators to quickly identify and address any potential issues or disturbances, help to prevent outages and minimise the impact of service disruptions; Consolidate data streams from otherwise dispersed sources to create unified visualisations and consolidated analytics that offer insights into the performance of distributions substations; Develop the concept of a flexible and programmable electricity distribution grid in which the substation is a centre of intelligence that facilitates optimal power routing while ensuring the resilience of the electricity grid. The demonstration, test and validation of the activities should be carried out in at least two pilots in different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries. The projects should propose a set of best practices and recommendations on effective overarching principles and operational measures for: (i) building smart distribution substations, and (ii) integrating them into a more resilient, intelligent, and responsive distribution grid which is able to tackle disturbances and address net congestion. The selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative, actively participate in its activities. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Improved observability, monitoring and control of the electricity distribution grids; Optimised management (including maintenance) of the grids by system operators and improved system resilience (including withstanding natural hazards and cybersecurity incidents); Grid operators integrate in their practices real-time decision-making. These could be assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, if applicable; A ''smart substation ecosystem’ is created that includes distribution system operators, technology/solution providers, integrators, application developers etc. This should cover both high-to-medium and medium-to-low voltage levels.',

      'short description Projects should demonstrate the integration of power electronics, IEDs, and software solutions and enable real-time monitoring of grid conditions for increasing the system resilience. Call objectives Projects are expected to: Demonstrate the integration of power electronics, intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), and software solutions in the distribution substations or in their proximity; Demonstrate real-time monitoring and analysis of grid conditions (including power quality, voltage levels, grid component monitoring, and overall system performance) that allow operators to quickly identify and address any potential issues or disturbances, help to prevent outages and minimise the impact of service disruptions; Consolidate data streams from otherwise dispersed sources to create unified visualisations and consolidated analytics that offer insights into the performance of distributions substations; Develop the concept of a flexible and programmable electricity distribution grid in which the substation is a centre of intelligence that facilitates optimal power routing while ensuring the resilience of the electricity grid. The demonstration, test and validation of the activities should be carried out in at least two pilots in different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries. The projects should propose a set of best practices and recommendations on effective overarching principles and operational measures for: (i) building smart distribution substations, and (ii) integrating them into a more resilient, intelligent, and responsive distribution grid which is able to tackle disturbances and address net congestion. The selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative, actively participate in its activities. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Improved observability, monitoring and control of the electricity distribution grids; Optimised management (including maintenance) of the grids by system operators and improved system resilience (including withstanding natural hazards and cybersecurity incidents); Grid operators integrate in their practices real-time decision-making. These could be assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, if applicable; A ''smart substation ecosystem’ is created that includes distribution system operators, technology/solution providers, integrators, application developers etc. This should cover both high-to-medium and medium-to-low voltage levels.',

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipTo be eligible for funding, applicants must be established in one of the following countries: the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows: at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries. Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Projects are expected to include at least five distribution system operators (DSOs) operating across different geographies and climate conditions. This total number of DSOs per project could be distributed across the different pilots of a particular project. Additionally, collaboration is encouraged with the following entities: at least two suppliers of technologies for smart power substations; at least one TSO. This collaboration (minimum number of entities) is sought per project in total and does not necessarily apply per each pilot in particular. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',
