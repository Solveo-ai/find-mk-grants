      'short description This topic supports informal networking among neighbourhoods to exchange knowledge and experiences, build their capacity, facilitate innovation in policymaking to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification – including green gentrification – that may result from interventions aligned with the New European Bauhaus. Call objectives Strategies and interventions to regenerate neighbourhoods may lead to gentrification, a process that can bring revitalization, sustainable economic growth, diversity and integration but also segregation, insecurity, exclusion, displacement, loss of cultural identity, and socio-economic inequality. Mitigating the negative consequences of gentrification cannot be achieved without policy innovation. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Create a bottom-up network of neighbourhoods with a (potential) risk of gentrification, to facilitate peer exchange among all relevant stakeholders. Proposals should aim for the participation of at least 15 neighbourhoods located in urban, peri-urban and rural areas from different Member States and Associated Countries. Map neighbourhoods’ needs, challenges, trends and opportunities to inform policies and interventions that mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification and of integrating the New European Bauhaus values and principles. Identify, document, and disseminate current knowledge, evidence, policy design, tools, and best practices for tackling gentrification and translate the results into useful tools that address the identified needs, challenges and opportunities. Support local decision makers in better understanding: The main drivers of gentrification (such as overtourism, interim use and short term rental markets). The effect of housing market speculation, rental agreements and (lack of) housing policies (e.g. fiscal measures, funding instruments, legislative measures) on gentrification. The effects of gentrification on different socio-demographic groups, as well as on local identities and cultural heritage. The interplay between urban, peri-urban and rural gentrification. Address the issue of gentrification in the participating neighbourhoods through at least one of the following actions: Develop or revise local policies (such as those on social/economic/urban development, housing, planning, mobility, green transition) to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification. Develop neighbourhood regeneration strategies that include measures to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as local or regional public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, cultural institutions, etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture, urban design, design, arts, (civil) engineering). This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals are expected to dedicate at least 0.2% of their total budget to share their intermediate and final results and findings with the Coordination and Support Action ''New European Bauhaus hub for results and impact'' (HORIZON-MISS-2024-NEB-01-03). read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Increased use of policies to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification and enhance its positive impacts (e.g. revitalization, sustainable economic growth, diversity and integration) in urban, peri-urban, and rural neighbourhoods. Increased capacity of local policymakers to anticipate and mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification when designing and implementing policies in alignment with the New European Bauhaus.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

      'short description The Programme is launching the second call for project platforms, under Priority 4 ‘Cooperation governance’, Programme objective 4.1 ‘Project platforms’. Call objectives Project platforms are Interreg Baltic Sea Region’s main capitalisation tool. They enable project partners to consolidate the outcomes of Interreg Baltic Sea Region projects, and integrate them with results from projects of other funding programmes. Project platforms support public authorities and relevant organisations in using consolidated project results in their work. This is how they help them govern and manage their areas more effectively. This, in turn, allows to tackle territorial challenges and influence policy improvements with greater impact. By bringing partners from Interreg Baltic Sea Region projects and other EU funded projects together, project platforms are operations of strategic importance (OSI). They provide a significant contribution to the achievement of the Programme objectives under Priority 1 Innovative societies, Priority 2 Water-smart societies, and Priority 3 Climate-neutral societies. Expected results Project platforms should contribute to one of the topics outlined below: Resilient and smart territories: to support urban and/or rural areas and their communities in applying consolidated solutions to make them more liveable, smart, and resilient environments responsive to the needs of both citizens and businesses. It could engage citizens and businesses in shaping communities through participation, inclusive decision-making, and sustainable development initiatives. It should contribute to Programme Objective 1.1 Resilient economies and communities or 1.2 Responsive public services. Social innovation for sustainable transformation: to support the systematic use of social innovation solutions for local and regional development. With human interaction at the core, social innovation could help drive a sustainable and fair transformation of cities and regions. It should contribute to Programme Objective 1.1 Resilient economies and communities. Closing water and nutrient loop: to support public authorities and further relevant organisations in the consistent uptake of solutions addressing various aspects of sustainable water and nutrient management, e.g. decreasing nutrient pollution, recycling nutrients, increasing water reuse, and applying nature-based solutions in nutrient management. It should contribute to Programme Objective 2.1 Sustainable waters. Safe navigation at sea: to support maritime authorities and the maritime sector in adopting solutions that enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability in Baltic Sea navigation. It could help improve decision-making, strengthen accident prevention, and facilitate better coordination through data sharing, risk management, and aligned safety standards. A project platform should contribute to Programme Objective 2.2 Blue economy. Circular food systems: to support public authorities, businesses, and civil society in adopting solutions to strengthen the resilience and circularity of food systems tailored to regional contexts. It could foster collaboration between food producers, consumers, and adjacent industries such as packaging, ensuring a comprehensive approach to sustainability. It could help transform business models and enhance public procurement practices. A project platform should contribute to Programme Objective 3.1 Circular economy. Uptake of alternative fuels: to support public authorities and industries in adopting and scaling alternative fuels, particularly hydrogen, across multiple sectors.

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipThe partnership of a project platform should be strategically crafted, involving project partners with comprehensive knowledge of their projects’ outcomes. It should be based on partners from ongoing or recently completed Interreg Baltic Sea Region projects, and involve partners from projects of other funding programmes. Projects can be from the current (2021-2027) or previous (2014-2020) funding periods as long as they provide useful results for capitalisation. Each partner of a project platform should either represent a project with relevant outcomes or act as a representative of a knowledge multiplier, like EUSBSR policy area coordinators, pan-Baltic organisations, other international organisations, and networks of cities and regions. Project platform partners must represent at least two different projects from Interreg Baltic Sea Region and at least one project from another funding programme. It is encouraged to adopt a broader approach by involving partners from multiple projects across various funding programmes. This approach enriches the outcomes of a project platform, enhances its value for public authorities and other relevant organisations, and aligns with the strategic importance of project platforms. The project platform partnership must include at least three project partners from three different countries of the Interreg Baltic Sea Region Programme area: a lead partner and at least two project partners. At least two of the project partners have to be located in the territory of two different EU Member States in the Programme area. Given the strategic relevance of project platforms, applicants are encouraged to build partnerships that ensure a good outreach to relevant organisations in the Interreg Baltic Sea Region Programme area. As a general rule, organisations located in the regions belonging to the Programme area can become project partners. In exceptional cases, organisations from outside the Programme area can also apply as project partners. The partnership builds on the lead partner principle, requiring each project platform to designate a lead partner responsible for preparing and submitting the application. The lead partner should be a partner organisation from an Interreg Baltic Sea Region project or an EUSBSR policy area coordinator. Lead partners must fall into the legal status category “public” defined in the Programme Manual (chapter C.2.1). When involving project partners from other funding programmes, project platforms are encouraged to consider the following programmes: various Interreg programmes (inter alia, Central Baltic, South Baltic, Germany-Denmark, Aurora, Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak, Estonia-Latvia, Latvia-Lithuania, Lithuania-Poland, Sweden-Norway, Northern Periphery and Arctic, North Sea Region, Central Europe, Interreg Europe), as well as other EU funding programmes like Horizon Europe, LIFE, national and regional programmes under the ESF+ and ERDF, and instruments run by regional organisations such as the Council of the Baltic Sea States and the Swedish Institute. Additionally, project platforms are encouraged to involve other important stakeholders as associated organisations. other eligibility criteriaThe Programme area covers nine countries.

      'short description The objective of the I3 Instrument Strand 1 call for proposals is to support interregional innovation investments by offering consortia of innovation actors from the quadruple helix ecosystems the necessary financial and advisory support to bring their innovations to a mature level, ready for commercialisation and scale-up, while bridging and reducing the innovation divide in Europe with a strong cohesion policy focus of integrating all regions and in particular the less developed regions into European value chains. Call objectives Strand 1 of the I3 instrument seeks to increase the competitiveness and the resilience of EU value chains on the basis of interregional cooperation and shared smart specialisation areas. Thereby, applications under this call seek to facilitate: the development of already existing or the creation of new interregional and cross-border value chains and a better connection between regional innovation ecosystems; the collaboration between innovation actors, especially SMEs, from less developed regions and innovation actors, especially SMEs, from more developed regions, contributing to cohesion policy objectives; the support of innovation actors with investment ideas that are ready to be developed into mature business cases; the identification of new regional technological domains and market opportunities with the EU priorities and bridging the gap between the supply and demand sides to help innovation ecosystems overcome market failures. I3 Instrument business investment cases start with a minimum TRL 6 and have the ambition to facilitate demonstration and to accelerate market uptake and commercialisation. The development of the business and investment cases is facilitated by the regional innovation ecosystems with companies in the lead. The support to be provided shall be (a) financial support, through direct funding to consortium beneficiaries or through cascade funding/financial support to third parties (FSTP), and (b) non-financial support, such as business and investment planning, protection of IPR, certification, commercialisation, standardisation, tailored support for the integration of KETs/deep tech in production processes, support in testing, demonstration and piloting new solutions. At the end of the project implementation, all involved regions and partners should have a clear perspective on how to exploit and build on the I3 project results, including through the broad introduction of new products, services, or production processes. Applications under this call for proposals must address one of the following thematic priorities: Digital transition or Green transition or Smart manufacturing Each project application under this call must address one thematic priority. 1. Digital transition Digital technologies present an enormous growth potential for Europe. This thematic priority targets investments in businesses and public administrations (notably in the part related to the innovation sector) with regards to the digital transition.

Within a specific thematic/technological area of cooperation, the project portfolio might be composed of several investment-ready sub-projects that address one or several bottlenecks in a value chain identified in the application. These sub-projects are necessary to test and demonstrate the validity of technologies/solutions and accelerate innovation uptake, thus increasing the competitiveness of EU value chains. The proposal must clearly describe the progress from innovation towards commercialisation and upscaling that is expected as a result of the project and its investment portfolio. The proposal must also provide an outline of an exploitation plan that sets out the expected way forward following the completion of the project, in particular, if the new products/processes or services supported by the I3 Instrument are not yet ready for the market. Target investments can be both tangible and intangible investments in the form of one or more of the following activities: Financial support for producing plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services such as demonstrating, testing and piloting activities by companies, large-scale product validation and market replication (new to Europe and new to the application sector); Adaptation of existing prototypes (i.e., by combining two or more key enabling technologies) and tailoring them to the companies’ needs for the demonstration in a real environment (ex-novo prototyping is not eligible); Development of portfolios of projects for close-to-market investments that deploy new or improved technologies or processes; Activities directly aiming at producing plans, arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services (adaptation to the companies’ needs). This can include testing, demonstration, piloting, large-scale product validation and market replication; Activities connecting or making complementary use of testing and demonstration facilities to accelerate market uptake and scale-up of innovative solutions in shared smart specialisation areas; Innovation services for the development of the business investment interconnecting value chains; Test beds and complementary activities needed to improve regulations, standards and/or to remove barriers and bottlenecks to innovation; Activities bringing innovative ideas and new products to the market; Advisory support for investment (developing or implementing interregional business and “go to market” investment plans in specific value chains). Support actions for networking, for testing new approaches for better innovation support or for enhancing services to SMEs (through collaboration, peer-learning or matchmaking, etc.) are also encouraged, particularly when aimed at replicating project outcomes in less developed regions. These support actions will only be eligible in combination with the implementation of the tangible and intangible investment listed above. This I3 Instrument Strand 1 call for proposals will not support activities that do significant harm to environment objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. I3 funding therefore cannot be awarded to projects that do not comply with this principle (e.g. any proposal dedicated to increase the efficiency of fossil fuel technologies or of fossil fuels). Applicants will need to verify that their proposal complies with this requirement. Activities (financial and non-financial support) must reflect a balanced participation of beneficiaries from regions with varying levels of development and innovation performance, with a strong emphasis on supporting and leveraging the potential of less developed regions and other categories of regions (such as EU outermost regions or regions with specific challenges). Involvement of these regions should be reflected both in terms of balanced budget distribution and ensuring their participation results in concrete benefits for these regions. read more',

      'short description In post-conflict areas, lives of civilians are in danger and the return of economic activity is hindered because the land is contaminated by anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance. The EU provides a continuous support to humanitarian demining activities in heavily mine-affected countries and regions all over the world, thus promoting peace, security, post-conflict reconstruction, as well as social and economic rehabilitation. Call objectives In Ukraine, mine action is a critical aspect of the humanitarian emergency response, the goal of which is to support the return of the civilian population and the rebuilding of crucial civilian infrastructure. As part of their mine action operations, EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, such as Croatia, Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Armenia also strive to make their land completely free of anti-personnel mines and other explosive ordnance. Humanitarian demining is not to be confused with military demining, which is the process undertaken by soldiers to clear a safe path so they can advance during conflict. Various humanitarian demining initiatives have been developed, which often incur high costs and are typically slow because no mistakes are allowed. In addition, due to a large diversity of contaminated areas, types of anti-personnel mines and of their deployment methods, as well as a more complex contamination that includes unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices, there is no single solution to the problem. Finally, new anti-personnel mines are being developed and new mine deployment techniques being used. Therefore, new, improved, innovative or disruptive solutions, accompanied by related training curricula, are needed to enhance humanitarian demining activities in civil areas. Since the aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security, it has to be complemented by an adequate risk education, raising awareness of civilians of the risks from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance, which will help them act in such a way that will reduce the risk to people and the environment. A range of risk education initiatives exist, but they usually lack, among others, collaboration with related Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), sustainability, and a comprehensive needs assessment aiming to improve their effectiveness. Within this topic, improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners are expected, which are adapted to regional and cross-border contexts. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals should also explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU and international level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Proposals are also expected to connect and create synergies and explore complementarities with other related initiatives in humanitarian demining and in explosive ordnance risk education. Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological (humanitarian demining) and societal (explosive ordnance risk education) dimensions in a balanced way. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes. Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular Ukrainian national mine action authorities, researchers and innovators, demining agencies or companies as well as NGOs. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners involved in humanitarian demining and Unexploded Ordnance Disposal (UXO) of civil areas, taking into account all applicable legislation and fundamental rights; Improved education activities aimed at reducing risks of injuries from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance; Enhanced understanding of the key challenges and best practices related to humanitarian demining and to unexploded ordnance risk education taking into account the experience of Ukrainian participants; Evidence-based support to policy-makers on shaping of the EU mine action.',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaThis topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least one international humanitarian demining organisation and two local or regional Non-Governmental Organisations active in humanitarian demining from at least three different EU Member States or Associated Countries, including Ukraine. For these participants, applicants must fill in with all the requested information, following the template provided in the submission IT tool. The participation of at least one entity from Ukraine in the consortium is mandatory with competences in humanitarian demining / Unexploded Ordnance Disposal (UXO).
