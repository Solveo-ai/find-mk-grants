    'short description The overall objective is to ensure the full transposition of the acquis communautaire and its progressive implementation by well-structured and trained administration aiming to secure a high level of public health, animal health, animal welfare and plant health at the national and EU level. Call objectives The specific objective of this call is to support negotiation process, further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy within relevant competent authorities of the Republic of Serbia for Chapter 12: Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, Ministry of Health etc.). In 2013, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and the Republic of Serbia entered into force. Article 1, Section2 (d) of the SAA states that the aim of the Association established is "to support the efforts of Serbia to develop its economic and international cooperation, including through the approximation of its legislation to that of the Community". Working with MS partner/s will assist the Republic of Serbia in further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy and in enhancing economic integration with the European Union’s single market. The international project experts will assist the administrative structures in the Republic of Serbia in charge of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy in meeting opening and closing benchmarks and in meeting conditions within Chapter 12. Furthermore, Title VI-Approximation of law, law enforcement and competition rules, Article 72, Section 1 of the SAA states "the Parties recognize the importance of the approximation of the existing legislation in Serbia to that of the Community and of its effective implementation. Serbia shall endeavour to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation will be gradually made compatible with the Community acquis. Serbia shall ensure that existing and future legislation will be properly implemented and enforced". With respect to aforementioned, one of the mandatory results of the project will be implementation of Law on Official Controls supported through trainings, legislation guidelines, etc. intended for inspection services (Agricultural, Veterinary and 5 Phytosanitary Inspection (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management) and Sanitary Inspection (Ministry of Health)). The national Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development 2014-2024 was adopted by the Government of the Republic of Serbia in 2014 and in Section 3.3.3. Activities on the implementation of strategic objectives, this document reports "the first steps towards establishing and improving existing institutions, organizations and other entities have been taken. A large number of laws and regulations have been adopted, but their effective implementation is still in most areas, at early stages. Further harmonization will be based on EU legislation (acquis communautaire), along with the continued training of administration, entrepreneurs, farmers and all other stakeholders in the implementation of this very demanding legislation". For instance, the implementation of the Animal Health Law will be accomplished through trainings, legislation, guidelines, etc. envisaged within the project and intended for inspection services, veterinary service and laboratories. The same document states improving the quality and safety of products as one of the priority areas (page 76). It says "Improving the system and capacity in the area of food safety and quality entails creating an environment in which all relevant stakeholders in the production chain (public authorities and organisations, food industry, academia and consumers) adhere to the standards of the Codex alimentarius, taking responsibility and ensuring the safety and quality of food." The Progress Report 2024 (Commission Staff Working Document) from October 2024, under Section 5. Ability to assume the obligations of membership, Cluster 5: Resources, Agriculture and Cohesion, Chapter 12: Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy states that: Serbia is moderately prepared in the area of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy. No progress was made during the reporting period. The Commission’s recommendations from last year were not implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular: adopt framework legislation on food safety, official controls, animal welfare and genetically modified organisms, aligned with the EU acquis; strengthen administrative capacity to ensure correct implementation; adopt and start implementation of the national plan to align legislation with EU quality standards for raw milk; prioritise the process of upgrading food establishments to be in line with the EU acquis. The above listed documents apparently show that there is a necessity for further alignment with EU acquis in food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy, as well as a need for further adjustment of relevant institutional capacities necessary to reduce resulting gaps and fulfil needs and obligations originating from these documents and from negotiation process. read more Expected results Component 1: Strategic and legislative framework of the Republic of Serbia supported in meeting conditions within Chapter 12: Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy Result 1.1.

    'short description The awarded consortium will be responsible for designing, developing, and implementing an app for truckers, free of charge, where drivers and operators can access detailed information about any point of interest, and provide their feedback. The information generated by the app should also be made available and exploitable by third party systems. The work includes the identification of points of interest in scope, defining main indicators and information needs of truckers, determine functional requirements, development of the app and the supporting systems, testing, deployment and communication. Call objectives 1. Improve Working Conditions for Truck Drivers The app will empower drivers by giving them the means to rate and review rest areas, service stations, and facilities. This feedback loop will help other users identify gaps in quality and accessibility, pushing providers to upgrade their standards improving daily working conditions on the road. 2. Address the Shortage of Drivers By highlighting high-quality, driver-friendly infrastructure and working environments, the app contributes to making the profession more attractive. Transparent information and peer reviews help new and existing drivers be informed and take quality choices, making them more likely to stay or join the industry. 3. Safe and Secure Parking The app will map, and rate parking areas based on security, cleanliness, availability, and amenities. This enables drivers to plan rest stops more confidently and safely. It will also give visibility to decision makers and businesses on where are the main gaps and underserve areas across the whole EU road infrastructure. read more Expected effects and impacts Building a reliable and user-friendly platform to access information and provide feedback on truckers points of interest, will reduce the existing information asymmetries in the market. Truckers will have advance access to reliable, community-driven information about services at points of interest along their route, including ratings and comments on service quality. This information, based on feedback from previous drivers, will guide decisions made by truckers and transport managers at various stages of their operations—whether negotiating contracts, planning routes, or performing a transport operation. By relying on the experiences of others, they will prioritize stops and rest areas that have the highest approval ratings from the wider community. The reputational value of points of interest will drive demand towards the highest-rated locations, while reducing truck stops at those with the lowest ratings. Administrators of these points of interest will have a clear incentive to invest in better infrastructure and service quality to improve their reputation, thereby increasing consumer demand and positively impacting overall business performance. The app will create a virtuous cycle that shifts the market dynamics towards a focus on service quality, significantly improving the working conditions of truck drivers by harnessing their consumer power. Additionally, the app will shed light on undignified situations and poor conditions in which truck drivers are often treated, raising awareness and driving positive change. The app will empower truck drivers by allowing them to share their opinions, report bad practices, and make informed decisions. The app will make each community member, an agent in the push for dignify working conditions within their profession. By fostering a sense of solidarity and accountability, the app will not only improve individual experiences but also drive systemic change. The long-term consequences of this project if it succeed will be far-reaching. It can contribute to a more attractive profession for truckers and increased respect for the vital role they play in the economy. The project will help alleviate the current shortage of drivers, often attributed to poor working conditions and low job satisfaction. As a result, the trucking industry will benefit from improved productivity, reduced turnover rates, and a more skilled and motivated workforce, ultimately leading to a more competitive and resilient transportation network. read more Expected results Activities to be supported under this action shall consist of technical and organisational activities to facilitate the development and deployment of the truckers’ points of interest information and rating app and interoperability services, also known as “Empowering Truckers” app. Activity 1 – Market research, user requirements identification and scoping. Conduct market research: Understanding the nature of the transport and logistic sector and the problem that is intended to be tackled (poor facilities and road infrastructure and quality of services for professional truck drivers). Identifying the landscape of key stakeholders, including professional truck drivers, fleet managers, transport companies and service providers at points of interest (e.g., rest areas, fueling stations, loading and unloading sites). Assessing similar solutions in the market centered around consumer-feedback, evaluating their key features, business model and their overall strengths and gaps. Evaluating other platforms and IT services used by truck drivers to plan, manage or get informed about services on the road (booking parking spots, trip planning, ...) or to conduct their business such as Transport Management Systems or Freight Exchange Platforms. Exploring the landscape of potential partnerships with service providers, industry associations and technology developers that could facilitate and drive the adoption of the app. Conduct focus groups or any other form of stakeholder engagement activities targeting specially the main users of the tool (truck drivers), as well as other users of the tool such as transport managers or points of interest administrators to identify the key user requirements and information needs. Define the business goals, scope, use cases, user requirements and rating metrics of the solution using the results of the market research and stakeholders'' engagement activities. Define the key metrics for the evaluation of the project. Activity 2 – App design and conceptualisation Define the app''s functional requirements: Define the app''s primary features and capabilities, identifying the app’s core functionalities. Outline user journeys and describe user cases. Determine technical requirements and architecture in accordance with performance and security needs: app speed, reliability, offline capabilities and scalability, data governance and user authentication and authorization policies. Create wireframes and first prototypes of the app, laying out the structure and flow of the app, sketching the app’s user interface, defining the structure of each screen and the key interactive elements. Test and validate first concepts iterating and refining the initial design, based on stakeholder''s feedback. In view of the second pre-financing payment up to 20% of the total price, a progress report is required covering the work completed under Activity 1 and 2. Activity 3 – App development Design the visual elements and user experience (UI/UX) of the app, focusing on usability, accessibility, and aesthetics creating an intuitive and engaging interface for users. Develop the front-end of the app, focusing on the design, functionality, and interaction. Develop the back-end server infrastructure, databases, and functions that will support the app’s functionality and store user data. Develop the web service or API that will enable third-party applications to access and utilize the data within the app, providing a seamless way to integrate app information into external systems. Allow external developers to fetch data such as user reviews, service ratings, and location details, enriching their own applications and expanding the app''s ecosystem. Activity 4 – App testing and piloting Test the app thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. This stage includes functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) as well as the integration with third parties. Pilot the app by releasing it to a small group of external users for real-world testing and feedback. Introduce the necessary adjustments to the app, with the insights and lessons obtained during the beta phase. In view of the third pre-financing payment up to 20% of the total price, a progress report is required covering the work completed under Activity 3 and 4. Activity 5 – Launch and promotion Deploy the app in app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store) for public download. Implement and execute a marketing and adoption strategy. Monitor the app performance and provide maintenance and support. Evaluate the project performance using the metrics defined in Activity 1. Activity 6 – Governance and strategy a. Project management Regular coordination with Commission services. Establishment of a Steering Committee with all participating members of the project. Management of high-level relationship (such as through the signature of cooperation agreements) with major organisations. Liaison with similar initiatives in the transport sector. Engagement with key stakeholders during the different phases of the project. b. Long-term governance of the project Establishment of a long-lasting sustainable governance structure that allows for the continuation of the project activities beyond its planned timeframe, with the following objectives: Provide maintenance and support to the app. Continuously improve the app based on user feedback and analytics.
