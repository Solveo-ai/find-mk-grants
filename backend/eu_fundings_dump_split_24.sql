    'short description Proposals are expected to provide in-depth assessments that will lead to novel solutions improving critical aspects of specific renewable energy technologies and their respective value chains impacting EU’s energy security. Call objectives Proposals are expected to focus on the development of solutions for these critical aspects, which could highly improve the overall capacity of the specific value chain in contributing to an improved energy security for Europe in the long run. The projects must address precisely only one of the following areas: Area 1- Sustainability and social awareness of specific renewable energy value chains as a limiting factor for their roll-out and performance over time (this is expected to be addressed either for hydropower or bioenergy); Area 2- Skills for renewable energy value chains as a limiting factor for innovation and deployment of relevant clean energy technologies; Area 3- Complexity for specific renewable energy value chains (this is expected to be addressed either for grid based RFNBOs and/or direct solar fuels and can for example include issues such as necessary market interactions for substrates, or interfaces between different reactions). Applicants must explicitly indicate to which of these three areas they apply. Proposals are expected to build on the results of the Study on clean energy R&I opportunities to ensure European energy security by targeting challenges of distinct energy value chains for 2030 and beyond. read more Expected results The security of Europe`s clean energy system will, in the long-run, benefit from research and innovation addressing energy-security relevant criticalities of the underlying clean energy technology value chains. Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes, from which all actors of European clean energy value chains can benefit: Strengthened European knowledge base, skills, research and industrial leadership on solutions for energy-security related aspects of renewable energy value chains; Technical and value chain solutions are developed addressing key aspects improving the energy security of renewable energy technologies; Strengthened availability of skilled labour (crafts, science and business) in order to increase the intra-European share of entire value chains; Improved competitiveness, sustainability including social awareness, and resilience of European renewable energy value chains. read more',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description The aim of this call for proposals is to support transnational research and/or innovation projects that help cities tackle urban challenges and transition towards a climate neutral and resilient future for all. Projects should contribute to one or more of our three thematic areas, the Transition Pathways: 15-minute City, Circular Urban Economies and Positive Energy Districts. Call objectives The 15-minute City Transition Pathway (15mC TP) addresses challenges of urban mobility, logistics, public space and proximity-based policies to promote implementation of climate neutral, resilient neighbourhoods for all. It draws on research and innovation projects to showcase a diverse mosaic of approaches that drive mobility transitions. The 15mC TP aims to enable analysis, development and testing of ideas, tools and innovations for 15-minute cities within co-creative and transdisciplinary settings. The Circular Urban Economies Transition Pathway (CUE TP) aims to foster urban places, communities and neighbourhoods that are sustained by circular resource flows and enhance the wellbeing of their inhabitants and ecosystems. It encourages urban planning and design characterised by regenerative urbanism, favouring the combination of circular principles, urban greening, and equal access to urban spaces and resources. The Positive Energy Districts Transition Pathway (PED TP) aims to develop innovative solutions for planning, large-scale implementation, and replication of PEDs across Europe’s urban and peri-urban areas. By combining energy efficiency, renewable energy production, and energy flexibility at the local level, PEDs offer and contribute to affordable energy systems, affordable quality housing, and competitive, resilient and inclusive local economies for cities through energy communities, contributing to European goals such as the SET Plan and the EU Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities. read more Expected results The basis for the Call topics descriptions are the three Transition Pathways (TP): 15-minute City, Positive Energy Districts and Circular Urban Economies. For each TP, three topics are defined as focus areas for this year’s Call. Since urban transition issues are intrinsically interconnected, a proposal may address several topics, from one or more TP. Whilst, crosscutting projects, which combine topics from more than one TP, are encouraged, each project must choose one TP topic that is closest to their subject as a guide. The proposal will be evaluated on the criteria of its main TP. Crosscutting characteristics will be considered in the assessment. 15-minute City Transition Pathway (15mC TP) - more information on pages 13-18 of the call document The 15mC TP topics in this call emphasise the “Shift” and “Avoid” strategies of mobility policy. They invite proposals to drive governance and social innovations, apply technology and develop business models to advance evidence, tools and policies for inclusive, sustainable and resilient urban mobility. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary projects are particularly encouraged, aiming to engage diverse stakeholders and co-creation approaches for a just transition. Over the years, the 15mC TP aims to develop a portfolio of innovations, tools and approaches. These will result from DUT-funded projects, tested in local case studies and living labs and ultimately serve as practical models showcasing feasible ways to promote urban mobility transitions. The 15mC topics in Call 2025 are: Next steps for multimodal urban mobility, building on travel experience Reimagining parking – transforming urban parking policies Mobility policymaking in context of radical contestation Circular Urban Economies Transition Pathway (CUE TP) - more information on pages 18-23 of the call document The CUE TP aims to foster urban places, communities and neighbourhoods that are sustained by circular resource flows and enhance the wellbeing of their inhabitants and ecosystems. It encourages urban planning and design characterised by regenerative urbanism, favouring the combination of circular principles, urban greening, and equal access to urban spaces and resources. The CUE topics in DUT Call 2025 are focused around: Resilience aspects of combining green and social infrastructure, Circular benefits and challenges for sustainable tourism, and Public procurement to foster urban greening and circularity. Positive Energy Districts Transition Pathway (PED TP) - more information on pages 23-30 of the call document The PED TP aims at supporting the planning, implementation and replication of PEDs throughout Europe. As a concept, the PED concept supports the vision of future urban energy systems, by both optimising energy efficiency and facilitating the generation of renewable energy, from the scale of city districts down to individual buildings. Moreover, urban districts following the PED approach will be able to support the regional or national energy system through the smoothing of energy production peaks, management of demand and facilitating the exchange and storage of energy. Beyond these technical characteristics, PEDs enable the combination of energy efficient buildings and their associated district grids with architectural and social innovation. Public involvement in its design plays a key role in the successful realisation of a PED, with public administrations, real estate developers, utilities and the public at large, functioning as supporting pillars. Through their combined efforts, these actors enable a PED to raise the quality of life in the city, contribute to the Paris Agreement targets and enhance cooperation between stakeholders in any urban governance system. At the core, we define PEDs as follows (PED Framework Definition): Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) are energy-efficient and energy-flexible urban areas that produce local renewable energy, achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions and play an active role in the energy system for achieving overall climate neutrality. The PED topics of DUT Call 2025 focus on the linking PED solutions in wider context to support mainstreaming and scaling of the concept in a multi-level perspective. A strong focus is on exploring innovative solutions in light of their socio-economic impact and providing evidence for social and socio-economic benefits of PED development. The PED topics in DUT Call 2025 are: Driving a just transition: PED strategies in social and subsidised housing Ensuring positive socio-economic impact: PEDs in local economies and energy markets PEDs in urban heating and cooling strategies For topics with a stronger technological focus, the Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CET Partnership) Call 2025 is recommended. read more',

    'short description The aim of this call for proposals is to support transnational research and/or innovation projects that help cities tackle urban challenges and transition towards a climate neutral and resilient future for all. Projects should contribute to one or more of our three thematic areas, the Transition Pathways: 15-minute City, Circular Urban Economies and Positive Energy Districts. Call objectives The 15-minute City Transition Pathway (15mC TP) addresses challenges of urban mobility, logistics, public space and proximity-based policies to promote implementation of climate neutral, resilient neighbourhoods for all. It draws on research and innovation projects to showcase a diverse mosaic of approaches that drive mobility transitions. The 15mC TP aims to enable analysis, development and testing of ideas, tools and innovations for 15-minute cities within co-creative and transdisciplinary settings. The Circular Urban Economies Transition Pathway (CUE TP) aims to foster urban places, communities and neighbourhoods that are sustained by circular resource flows and enhance the wellbeing of their inhabitants and ecosystems. It encourages urban planning and design characterised by regenerative urbanism, favouring the combination of circular principles, urban greening, and equal access to urban spaces and resources. The Positive Energy Districts Transition Pathway (PED TP) aims to develop innovative solutions for planning, large-scale implementation, and replication of PEDs across Europe’s urban and peri-urban areas. By combining energy efficiency, renewable energy production, and energy flexibility at the local level, PEDs offer and contribute to affordable energy systems, affordable quality housing, and competitive, resilient and inclusive local economies for cities through energy communities, contributing to European goals such as the SET Plan and the EU Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities. read more Expected results The basis for the Call topics descriptions are the three Transition Pathways (TP): 15-minute City, Positive Energy Districts and Circular Urban Economies. For each TP, three topics are defined as focus areas for this year’s Call. Since urban transition issues are intrinsically interconnected, a proposal may address several topics, from one or more TP. Whilst, crosscutting projects, which combine topics from more than one TP, are encouraged, each project must choose one TP topic that is closest to their subject as a guide. The proposal will be evaluated on the criteria of its main TP. Crosscutting characteristics will be considered in the assessment. 15-minute City Transition Pathway (15mC TP) - more information on pages 13-18 of the call document The 15mC TP topics in this call emphasise the “Shift” and “Avoid” strategies of mobility policy. They invite proposals to drive governance and social innovations, apply technology and develop business models to advance evidence, tools and policies for inclusive, sustainable and resilient urban mobility. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary projects are particularly encouraged, aiming to engage diverse stakeholders and co-creation approaches for a just transition. Over the years, the 15mC TP aims to develop a portfolio of innovations, tools and approaches. These will result from DUT-funded projects, tested in local case studies and living labs and ultimately serve as practical models showcasing feasible ways to promote urban mobility transitions. The 15mC topics in Call 2025 are: Next steps for multimodal urban mobility, building on travel experience Reimagining parking – transforming urban parking policies Mobility policymaking in context of radical contestation Circular Urban Economies Transition Pathway (CUE TP) - more information on pages 18-23 of the call document The CUE TP aims to foster urban places, communities and neighbourhoods that are sustained by circular resource flows and enhance the wellbeing of their inhabitants and ecosystems. It encourages urban planning and design characterised by regenerative urbanism, favouring the combination of circular principles, urban greening, and equal access to urban spaces and resources. The CUE topics in DUT Call 2025 are focused around: Resilience aspects of combining green and social infrastructure, Circular benefits and challenges for sustainable tourism, and Public procurement to foster urban greening and circularity.

From the culture and creative sectors (e.g. artists and designers) Eligibility rules for the consortia and Applicants: Transnational eligibility rule 1: Each proposal must be submitted by a consortium consisting of at least three eligible Applicants from at least three different participating countries (see Annex A). Only Applicants eligible for funding by the participating Funding Agencies from the following countries are eligible to apply as Main Applicant or Co-applicant: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Tunisia and Türkiye. In addition, at least two of the eligible Applicants must be from different EU Member States (MS) or Associated Countries (AC) to the Horizon Europe eligible for EC co-funding in this Call: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and Türkiye. All legal entities must be independent from each other to be considered as different applicants. Please pay careful attention to the specific Funding Agencies’ rules regarding eligibility of applicants in Annex A since not all Funding Agencies can support all types of Applicants. Ineligible Applicants (e.g. from other countries or ineligible to receive funding from a participating Funding Agency) may participate as a Cooperation Partner. Transnational eligibility rule 2: The Main Applicant (project coordinator) must be eligible to be funded and request funding by its national/regional participating Funding Agency. Transnational eligibility rule 3: A Principal Investigator (PI) must only participate in a maximum of two proposals, and only once as the PI of a Main Applicant. If the DUT Call Secretariat, in charge of checking transnational eligibility, identifies the same person as PI in more than two pre-proposals, or as PI of the Main Applicant of more than one pre-proposal, all pre-proposals/full proposals in which they are a PI, will be declared ineligible. Transnational eligibility rule 4: Consortia must include at least one urban governmentauthority (city, municipality or entity providing key urban services, so long as this entity is owned by a local government (confirmation of this by the local government may be requested by the Call Secretariat)) either as a Main Applicant, Co-applicant, or Cooperation Partner depending on the national/regional eligibility criteria. other eligibility criteriaRecommendations for the consortia composition Consortia may include partners active across several positions within the research and development system (i.e., innovation, applied research, strategic/fundamental research) and across disciplines (natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities, engineering, etc.). Moreover, consortia should include preferably at least one representative from companies and commercial organisations, consumers or civil society, either as a Main Applicant, Co-applicant, or Cooperation Partner, depending on the national/regional eligibility criteria. Typically, small to medium sized consortia (involving funding requests to 3-5 Funding Agencies on average per proposal), are expected. However, there is no upper limit, and consortia may involve as many partners as necessary for a convincing proposal, ensuring that all participants have a justified role. Each partner within the consortium should clearly add value to the objectives of the proposed project. Depending on the nature of the project, each partner in the consortium must demonstrate how they will exploit the expected results. Consortia are expected to be balanced between countries, both in terms of number of partners and distribution of budget and no individual Applicant or Cooperation Partner may represent more than 50% of the workload calculated in terms of person-months. Consortia must integrate gender balance and other diversity aspects in the dedicated section of the proposal (see the Evaluation Criteria in section 4.5). It is also possible to include “widening” countries, as long as they are participating in the Call (see Annex A for a list of participating Funding Agencies). Please note that all consortium partners should serve a purpose that enhances the proposal; therefore, it is only recommended to add a widening partner (or any partner, for that matter) if their tasks provide a clear benefit to the success of the project. Also, Applicants should take into account the budgets and expected number of projects of all involved Funding Agencies (listed in Annex A of this document) when building the project consortium. A Funding Agency that receives to many applications will likely encounter budget issues, which may lead to most of those Applicants being eliminated due to financial constraints. Funding recommendations There are no fixed minimum or maximum limits for a project size. Medium sized projects with a total budget request from all involved Funding Agencies in the range of EUR 1-2 M are typically expected, though total project costs can be lower or higher. However, funding limits exist for many Funding Agencies. Annex A indicates the budget available from each Funding Agency and corresponding funding rules and limitations (namely maximum amount per project or per Applicant, or a range of funding demands expected from one proposal). In the proposal, a justification of the requested budget is required. The estimated budget must be given in euros only and be tabulated according to the proposal template provided. All costs must be eligible according to the Funding Agencies’ rules (see Annex A). In case of doubt, Applicants should consult their respective Funding Agencies.',

Proposals written in other languages will be ineligible. The proposal form should be filled in completely. Pre-proposals and full proposals must respect the total number of pages using a standard font size and normal page margins as indicated on the proposal form. Pre-proposals and full proposals must be submitted on the UEFISCDI electronic submission system, UDiManager (www.uefiscdi-direct.ro), before each associated deadline: the Call for pre-proposals is open until 17 November 2025, 13:00 (CET). In March 2025, applicants will be invited to enter the second stage of the procedure: the Call for full proposals will close on 23 April 2026, 13:00 (CEST). An online help document with guidelines for submission will be provided, detailing the procedures and duties of the Main Applicant and of other consortium partners. It is not possible to resubmit or revise the pre-proposal/full proposal after the submission deadline, unless it pertains to corrections to technical administrative details and is requested by the Call Secretariat. Only pre-proposals invited to submit a full proposal will be eligible in the second stage of the selection procedure. If a Main Applicant decides to submit a full proposal rejected at the end of the first stage, this full proposal will be declared ineligible. No fundamental changes initiated by the applicants alone between the pre-proposal and the full proposal will be accepted. Namely: the project objectives stated in the pre-proposal cannot be changed, the Main Applicant (and its PI) must stay the same, except in case of force majeure, the consortium (co-applicants) should stay the same (with the exception of the Inclusion possibilities allowed explicitly by the Call Secretariat, see call document section 4.1), only minor changes on the funding demand per Funding Agency can be allowed (except in the case adding Inclusion Procedure partners). changes in the consortium structure requested as part of the Fallback Procedure (see section 3.7 of the call document) are considered modifications requested by the Call Secretariat and are therefore exempt from this rule. The Call Secretariat may allow such modifications in exceptional cases, if duly justified. Modifications requested by a Funding Agency do not count as changes between the pre-proposal and the full proposal stages. By submitting a pre-proposal/full proposal, applicants agree that it will be forwarded to all Funding Agencies, which are receiving a request to provide funding for that proposal. Some Funding Agencies require submission of information on a national/regional level as well (see Annex A). Call documents DUT 2025 Call textDUT 2025 Call text(3629kB) Contact DUT Website',
