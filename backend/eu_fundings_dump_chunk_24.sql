Each action has specific objectives, supported activities, main target groups and terms and conditions. For more details, please consult the call document p. 11- 53. Action: Short supply chains The action contributes to the creation of short supply chains involving farmers, food producers, craftsmen and consumers with close geographical and social links and a shared commitment to local economic development in the cross-border region of Hungary and Slovakia. The proposed actions contribute to increasing opportunities and knowledge about short supply chains (SSC), especially with regard to today''s nutritional needs, food awareness and modern food production. The overall objectives of the Action are the followings: development of cross-border collaborations to improve the position of smallholder farmers and food producers in value chains increasing the retention of money in the local economy and agrotourism by supporting local producers and suppliers, services and local businesses producing more environmentally friendly products by reducing food miles and pollution building knowledge about the link between consumption and its impact on the environment through mindful consumption support pilot projects of SSC actors which represent a small-scale, time-limited trial designed to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact of a concept, product, or service before full-scale implementation. Action: Social innovations for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups The proposed action aims to improve the employability of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, facilitate their integration into the labour market, create quality and sustainable jobs and forms of employment, and combat poverty and social exclusion. Disadvantaged and vulnerable groups include persons excluded from the labour market, coming from segregated or marginalised communities and face various difficulties when entering the labour market (qualification, professional or personal deficits, regional disadvantages). Social innovations should improve the employability, reduce unemployment and underemployment, strengthen labour market participation and integration, social inclusion and the quality of life of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. Due to the complexity of the unmet needs of the target groups, complex projects should be developed, involving several complementary activities tailored to the needs of the target groups. The action supports the joint development or adaptation of social innovations that representing new methods and approaches to address unmet social needs based on new knowledge, experience and expertise. The program promotes cross-border cooperation and partnerships involving multiple stakeholders, enabling joint innovation (development of new methods, networks, services, and cooperation) and joint implementation of pilot projects which are small-scale, time-limited trials designed to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact of a concept, product, or service before full-scale implementation. Action: Inclusive and quality education The action aims to promote cross-border co-operation in building inclusive and high-performing education systems for educational communities with the presence of disadvantaged learners, aiming to foster their inclusion and equal participation. Disadvantaged learners include students from low-income families, coming from segregated or marginalised communities and students with learning, behavioural or developmental difficulties and disabilities. The action aims to improve educational outcomes and ensure equitable access to meaningful education and reduce the number of early school dropout. Integrated development – linking infrastructure investments with pedagogical innovation – is at the centre of this approach, as is the strengthening of teachers'' skills and the use of digital and AI-powered educational tools. The programme promotes cross-border cooperation and multi-stakeholder partnerships that enable mutual learning in particular local adaptation of best practises, knowledge exchange, joint innovation and the joint implementation of pilot projects aimed at sustainable change in formal and non-formal education institutions. Action: Family and community-based health care services The aim of the action is to improve access to healthcare, health literacy and thus the health status of thepopulation living in the programme area by supporting communities and families with activities, services and equipment that can be used by the population on both sides of the border. The action promotes family-based healthcare characterised by: holistic care for all family members across all ages prevention and early intervention such as immunisation maternal and child health services health education tailored to the family unit and support in managing chronic diseases in the home environment. The action also promotes community-based health services provided locally by health centres, outreach clinics or mobile health units. These include: involvement of community health workers or volunteers trained in primary health care public health programmes such as vaccination campaigns, sanitation and vector control health promotion activities such as awareness campaigns, screening and nutrition programmes and focus on equity and aim to reach underserved and vulnerable populations. Both countries are struggling with a shortage of general practitioners and doctors in outpatient sector. The ageing of the medical population, especially of general practitioners, is a serious challenge for the healthcare system. It is therefore important to support young doctors entering general practise and ensure that the system allows them a smooth transition into the world of work. The action supports the introduction of new technologies and approaches that improve the accessibility, efficiency and quality of healthcare in the general practitioner’s sector. The most important of these include digital transformation, personalised medicine, integrated care, prevention and education. Action: Cross-border development of healthcare institutions The action facilitates border crossings, that will promote the mobility of patients and healthcare professionals and improve access to quality healthcare services in the border area. In many cases there are parallel capacities and at the same time a lack of medical care on both sides of the border. The main aim of the actions is to further develop the healthcare facilities in the border region through a more efficient use of spatial, instrumental, electronic and innovative solutions in the provision of healthcare services and to use these improvements to provide services that can also be used for the population from the other side of the border. The aim of the action is to modernise healthcare facilities in the border area based on the real need and the potential cross-border mobility of patients, the lack of and parallel capacities and services of healthcare facilities in order to create truly cross-border healthcare services. read more',
