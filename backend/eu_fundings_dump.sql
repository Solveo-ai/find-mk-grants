    'short description This Call aims at accrediting recognised Higher Education Institutions located in eligible countries, which have operational capacity to take part in Erasmus+ Programme’s activities, such as learning mobility of individuals and/or cooperation for innovation and good practices. Call objectives The Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE) is an EU quality certificate for higher education institutions (HEIs). It is a prerequisite for all HEIs from Erasmus+ Programme countries and Western Balkans third countries not associated to the Programme to apply for funding under Erasmus+ calls (including calls managed by Erasmus+ National Agencies). By applying for the ECHE, the HEI confirms that its participation in Erasmus+ is part of its strategy for modernisation and internationalisation. This strategy acknowledges the key contribution of student and staff mobility and of participation in transnational cooperation projects, to the quality of its higher education programmes and student experience. The ECHE aims to reinforce the quality of student and staff mobility, as well as of cooperation projects. The certification procedure consists in validating the status as a ‘higher education institution (HEI)’ and certifying compliance with the ECHE quality standards (Erasmus Policy Statement, quality of organisation and management structures and the implementation of ECHE principles). The ECHE will be valid for the entire duration of the Erasmus+ Programme 2021-2027 (and up until the end of projects funded under that Programme). The award of the ECHE does not automatically imply any direct funding under the Erasmus+ Programme. ECHE holders will be subject to regular monitoring by the National Agencies. read more',

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipBoth partners with their own budget (project partners) and partners without their own budget (associated partners) can participate in an Interreg project. The basic rule in the program is that at least one Polish and one German partner always participate in the project - both with ERDF funds. Normally, all project partners are based in the participating regions of the program area. In justified exceptional cases, project partners based outside the program area can also participate in an Interreg project. The decisive prerequisite is that the project-related activities of the partner are carried out for the program area, achieve a visible added value for it and are essential for the implementation of the project. Project partners can be both public and private organizations. The project partners must nominate a lead partner. Only public organizations may assume this function in the program. The project partners must cooperate on the following two levels within the framework of the project: Joint preparation: regular meetings or coordination on project development, joint development of project content, objectives and scheduling, joint preparation of project documents. Joint implementation: activities of all project partners coordinated in terms of content and timing, joint project coordination, each project partner takes on at least one sub-task. In addition, the partners must cooperate on at least one of the following levels: Joint personnel: one or more project partners provide additional personnel or release existing personnel to carry out project tasks in the interests of all project partners. Joint financing: joint cost and financing plan of the project partners, in which each project partner assumes part of its own funds, each project partner pre-finances its share of the costs. Examples of recipients of funds Priority 2: State administrations Local and regional authorities and government agencies Universities and research institutions Non-governmental organizations and non-profit companies and institutions Priority 3: Education and training providers and universities Units of territorial self-government and state education administration Chambers of industry, commerce and crafts and other business-related institutions Trade unions employment offices Non-governmental organizations and non-profit companies and institutions. other eligibility criteriaOn the Polish side, the program area covers the entire West Pomeranian Voivodeship.

Normally, all project partners are based in the participating regions of the program area (program handbook chapter 1.3 Program area). As far as a more effective and higher cross-border added value of the projects is possible, the program also encourages project partners from the other German-Polish funding areas to be involved in the project implementation across the program. In justified exceptional cases, project partners based outside the program area can also participate in an Interreg project. The decisive prerequisite is that the project-related activities of the partner are carried out for the program area, achieve a visible added value for the program area and are essential for the implementation of the project. A lump sum of EUR 10,560.00 ERDF can be applied for to cover project preparation costs. A lump sum of EUR 6,720.00 ERDF can be applied for for project completion costs. Projects with a total budget of more than EUR 200,000 are considered regular projects. Projects with a total budget of up to EUR 200,000 and which are not carried out within the Small Project Fund (SPF) are to be treated as small-scale projects (Program Guide Chapter 4.4.3 Draft Budget). Funding applications in this call must have a minimum budget of over EUR 50,000 ERDF.

As part of our commitment to sustainable growth, we are also actively developing our financial sustainability strategy, as mandated by the EIT. The Innovation KAVA Projects are to contribute to these goals. Call objectives Europe’s Critical Raw Materials Act (CRM Act) sets ambitious goals for domestic production, processing, and recycling. To achieve these goals by 2030, Europe must: Increase domestic mining to supply at least 10% of Europe’s Critical Raw Materials’ needs. Expand processing capacity to cover 40% of Europe’s demand. Accelerate recycling efforts to reclaim 25% of end-of-life products. Diversify supply sources to ensure no more than 65% of any material comes from a single external country. EIT RawMaterials is committed to transform this vision into reality and making raw materials a strategic strength for Europe. We are the sectors’ leading knowledge and innovation community with more than 300 partners comprising the leaders in industry, research and technology, and academia in the raw materials sector. EIT RawMaterials has successfully deployed over EUR 600M in strategic funding under the Horizon Europe programme, unlocking secondary funding into research, innovation, upscaling, skills and raw materials projects of more than EUR 3.6B. The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA), led by EIT RawMaterials, has grown to over 750 members with an overall investment potential of EUR 50B and the potential to close the EU raw materials’ supply-demand gap by between 20-100% across a range of Critical and Strategic Raw Materials. read more',

University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project Partnership All organisations that are eligible for funding under the Horizon Europe programme can apply. You do not have to be an existing partner organisation of EIT RawMaterials to apply for funding, but by becoming one, you will gain access to a valuable source of expertise and potential collaborators. They will work with you and help build your consortium if, or when, you decide to apply for funding. We also encourage our partners and stakeholders from industry, research, and education, including start-ups and SMEs, to submit new project proposals. These projects should demonstrate how they will impact significantly on European industrial competitiveness, innovation capacity, and human capital, as well as empower students and entrepreneurs advancing the circular economy and the green and digital transition goals of the European Green Deal. The project Consortium must consist of a minimum of two Project participants, coming from a minimum of two different countries eligible for Horizon Europe funding, and a maximum of 5 Project participants. No more than 80% of the grant can go to one of the partner. The lead Project participant must be a Core or Associate Partner (or Linked Third Party to a Core or Associate Partner) of EIT RawMaterials by the time the project starts. The project Consortium must include Project participants from at least two sides of the knowledge triangle (education, research, industry/business - as defined in the Partner registration documentation). All EIT RawMaterials’ policies, including on diversity and inclusion, apply. Project participants that are non-members are eligible to apply as Members only if they submit an EIT RawMaterials membership application before the project starts. Failure to apply for EIT RawMaterials membership will result in their removal (including the requested funding) from the proposal (note that the project will be immediately terminated if eligibility criteria are not met at this stage). other eligibility criteria Upscaling KAVA projects are innovation projects based on validated technologies that need additional step(s) for testing, demonstration, proof of concept and up-scaling prior to commercialization. The purpose of these projects is to support good technologies, products, and services that are currently under development to reach market entry. All Projects must lead to specific deliverables and outputs over a defined timeline. Projects will be financed by EIT RawMaterials (the KIC) only for a defined duration. Proposals must meet the highest expectations and performance on the creation of impact (please refer to Strategic Agenda 2021-2027). This is mainly measured by achieving Core KPIs. Only the Proposals that are fully aligned with the EIT RawMaterials 2021-2027 Strategic Agenda will be considered for funding. In particular, the Proposal should address at least one of the topics listed in the Lighthouse Appendix and must be developed in close cooperation with the KIC staff that have been assigned to the Proposal. Proposals that do not address the topics listed in the Lighthouse Appendix will be considered for funding, but will be given lower priority The EIT RawMaterials Lighthouses are the following: Circular Societies Sustainable Materials Responsible Sourcing Upscaling Projects must aim for market introduction and/or a commercial use within 2 years or less after the end of Project, and shorter time for market introduction and/or a commercial use will be favourably evaluated. Projects that aim for commercialization within the project duration will be evaluated positively. The proposal must clearly state who (which Project participant) will be responsible for commercialisation, and outline a plan for market introduction. The Project should outline the Commercialising partners’ profile and/or main characteristics and must demonstrate that they have experienced marketing/finance/sales people on the team. Upscaling Projects need to be based on a solid market analysis, covering important aspects such as the business environment (e.g., technical, regulatory, social, environmental and political aspects, user needs and targeted applications, customer value proposition, target market(s) (e.g., size, structure, growth potential, segmentation), risk assessment, design or market studies, and intellectual property exploration. A preliminary market analysis must be included in the Proposal and will be the basis for the Go-to-market strategy that will be developed in Work Package 0 (WP0) during the project. The Go-to-market strategy will be updated throughout the duration of the Project and enable go/no-go decisions following quarterly or annual reviews. No-go decisions may result in various consequences, such as suspension or discontinuation of the funding. Projects that have the potential to become investment cases for the European Raw Materials Alliance within the funding period will be evaluated positively and will be given a priority over other projects that have achieved a similar score in the quality criteria. The technology must be at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 5 at the beginning of the project, corresponding to a “system complete and qualified”. Information must be provided in the Proposal to substantiate in detail how this will be achieved. The Project may be scored very low or even deemed to be ineligible without a detailed and convincing substantiation of this condition. At the end of the project, the technology is expected to have reached a TRL of at least 8, corresponding to a “system prototype demonstration in operational environment”. Information must be provided in the application to substantiate this claim, and the project may be scored very low or even deemed to be ineligible without it. Consortia are encouraged to consider offering our EIT RM Alumni an internship in their project and/or a site visit. Our Alumni are past or present participants in EIT RM Education, Innovation or Business Development activities and we strongly encourage you to register to the EIT Raw Materials Alumni community that is open not only to students. Indeed the EIT RM Alumni Association would assist in the logistics involved in an internship or study/Project visit. Proposals claiming to achieve any positive environmental impact, such as resource and energy savings, waste reduction, waste valorisation, emissions reduction, etc., must include a Work Package on the assessment of the environmental impacts of the developed products or processes using LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) methodologies.',

    'short description Better knowledge of how common spaces affect social relations is required to scale up successful common space initiatives across Europe. This topic seeks to produce insights on the impacts of common spaces (new, redesigned or redeveloped) on neighbourhoods and their communities. Call objectives One of the core NEB values is inclusion. The regeneration of common spaces can facilitate inclusiveness and social interaction in neighbourhoods by providing a safe, accessible, and attractive environment. Attractive, well-designed, well-maintained, and secure common spaces can bring people together for commercial, cultural, and leisure activities. A safe environment can also create a sense of trust and community among inhabitants. Recognising a neighbourhood''s diversity “not only improves social and spatial cohesion but also contributes to democratic, peaceful coexistence”. Social, economic, and cultural services and amenities that reflect this diversity and allow for people to come together and interact, can have a particular impact on inclusion and can lead to new forms of collaboration, solidarity and social recognition. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Study a range of common space projects in at least three EU Member States or Associated Countries, collecting data and drawing on evidence, to better understand: The medium and long-term impacts of common spaces on community cohesion, social interactions, active civic participation, resilience, diversity, as well as sense of security and belonging. This includes identifying if and to what extent these impacts vary in neighbourhoods with different characteristics, for example, in terms of social infrastructure, economy, housing ownership patterns, services, etc. How the design and maintenance of common spaces (including the process, for example relying on participatory approaches), the degradation of the bordering built environment, and the preservation of cultural heritage, influences the above identified effects of common space. How the integration of the three core NEB values in the design of common spaces impacts the above identified effects of common space. How the different groups of people (such as women, children, youth, older adults, people with disabilities, underrepresented, vulnerable and marginalised groups, LGBTIQA+) make use of and experience common spaces. How variations in the use of common spaces in different periods of the year influence community cohesion, social interactions, and civic participation. Based on the research evidence, provide recommendations for public administrations and other stakeholders involved in the regeneration of common spaces in neighbourhoods. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, cultural institutions, etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture or design, arts, (civil) engineering). This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals are expected to dedicate at least 0.2% of their total budget to share their intermediate and final results and findings with the Coordination and Support Action ''New European Bauhaus hub for results and impact'' (HORIZON-MISS-2024-NEB-01-03). read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Better understanding of the effects of the design, aesthetics and other features of common spaces on inhabitants’ behaviour (including e.g. their social interactions and recognition, civic participation, use of spaces and buildings), health, sense of belonging, diversity and inclusion, security, resilience, and opportunities to produce social, cultural and local economic value.

International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.

    'short description Regenerative design aims to actively restore, revitalise and enhance ecosystems, contributing to both human and planetary health, in line also with the ‘One Health’ approach. Regenerative design thus contributes to creating sustainable, thriving environments for local communities and ecosystems. This involves principles such as circularity, waste reduction, resource and energy efficiency, promoting biodiversity, and the use of carbon-storing materials. Call objectives Regenerative design offers pathways to develop construction and renovation methods and designs that go beyond conventional approaches. However, the potential and application of regenerative design in the built environment is still under-explored due to the novelty of the solutions, the complexity of inter-related factors, the limited understanding of their impacts, and insufficient knowledge exchange and technology transfer. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Analyse in depth the success factors, challenges, and impacts of at least 10 existing examples of regenerative designs applied to constructed or renovated buildings. Measure the restoration of the environment as well as sustainability performance of the building, using existing sustainable building assessment methods such as Level(s), the Living Community Challenge and other third-party certification schemes or emerging methodologies such as the Carbon Removal and Carbon Farming (CRCF) in buildings certification. The selected buildings are expected to: Be located in contexts as diverse as possible (geographical, environmental, climate, social or economic). Generate renewable energy to meet the buildings’ energy demand. The buildings can also employ, but are not limited to: nature-based solutions; water collection, purification and reuse; water efficiency methods; building solutions achieving cleaner air; carbon-storing architecture and design; medium and long-term energy storage (e.g. using phase-change materials). Have used collaborative, inclusive approaches to engage local communities and inhabitants. Have overcome legislative and regulatory barriers, if any, thanks to active collaboration with different levels of government and public authorities.

    'short description Research is required on the various aspects of using bottom-up social entrepreneurship for the co-creation of neighbourhoods. Call objectives Bottom-up social entrepreneurship can act as a key driver of sustainable and inclusive neighbourhood co-creation in line with the values of the New European Bauhaus. Bottom-up social entrepreneurship leverages local expertise to tackle local social and environmental challenges. It can generate local economic value, create new and inclusive employment opportunities, leverage cultural and creative industries, and address the segregation of different community and civil society groups, including marginalised and vulnerable inhabitants. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Deliver at least 3 bottom-up social entrepreneurship pilots in at least 3 Member States or Associated Countries to explore how bottom-up social entrepreneurship can shape and contribute to the co-creation of neighbourhoods in line with the values of the New European Bauhaus. Analyse for each pilot the local social, cultural, economic, financial, regulatory, and legal barriers and drivers and how they can shape the market uptake and competitiveness of bottom-up social enterprises and initiatives. Assess for each pilot the business case and the potential for bottom-up social entrepreneurship to create impact and attract (impact) investment opportunities. Demonstrate how cooperations between inhabitants and civil society actors can foster the exchange of knowledge and experiences and build their capacity to engage in bottom-up social entrepreneurship. These cooperations should take into consideration place-based specificities and be grounded in strong public-private partnerships including grassroots neighbourhoods associations, public authorities, local businesses, and the social economy, etc. Demonstrate how bottom-up social entrepreneurship can increase the quality of life and well-being of inhabitants, strengthen social cohesion, and foster a shared sense of belonging in neighbourhoods. Assess how the above may impact future co-creation and decision-making in the development of neighbourhoods in line with the New European Bauhaus. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, including from the social economy and civil society, investors etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture or design, arts, business, economics, finance, etc.). This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals are expected to dedicate at least 0.2% of their total budget to share their intermediate and final results and findings with the Coordination and Support Action ''New European Bauhaus hub for results and impact'' (HORIZON-MISS-2024-NEB-01-03). read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: New scientific evidence of how bottom-up social entrepreneurship shapes and contributes to the co-creation of neighbourhoods in line with the values of the New European Bauhaus. Inhabitants (including marginalised and vulnerable groups) and civil society actors share knowledge and experiences and have the capacity to cooperate and engage in bottom-up social entrepreneurship.

    'short description The application of design for adaptability and disassembly has focused on new constructions. However, most structures and spaces in urban, peri-urban and rural areas have already been built and require adaptation and repurposing for new and updated uses and functions. Therefore, research should address design for adaptability and disassembly for the renovation of existing buildings, common spaces, and infrastructures. Call objectives Design for adaptability and disassembly is a concept for the design of buildings, common spaces, and infrastructures integrating circular economy principles for greater economic, environmental and social sustainability. It presents significant potential for the renovation of the built environment by allowing for easy adaptation of spaces and structures to changing needs and uses or technological advancements. Renovating with modular components and elements that can be dis- and re-assembled and thereby repurposed across different applications further supports the long-term use, adaptation, and repurposing of buildings, common spaces, and infrastructures. This maximises their economic value (by retaining the embedded value of construction materials, components, and elements), improves their environmental performance (by reducing waste and the extraction of new raw materials and resources), and avoids their demolition as well as the construction of new structures. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Develop at least two renovation processes, methods, and/or techniques based on design for adaptability and disassembly that enable the future adaptation and repurposing of buildings, common spaces, and infrastructures with minimal usage disruption. Demonstrate the developed solutions in at least two pilots in at least two Member States or Associated Countries. At least one of the pilots must target a building and at least one of the pilots must target a common space and/or an infrastructure. Assess the barriers (including economic, environmental, cultural, social (including related to human capital and skills), and regulatory) to the market uptake of the developed solutions compared to conventional renovation processes, methods, and techniques, and propose solutions to overcome them. Quantify, wherever feasible, the environmental (including whole life carbon assessments, carbon pricing, energy efficiency, ecosystem services), economic (including reduced resource consumption costs), social (including the response to changing neighbourhood needs), cultural (including the regeneration of cultural meanings and heritage in neighbourhoods), financial and regulatory impacts of the processes, methods, and techniques, while considering the specificities of the local context.

    'short description Along with the current paradigm shift towards a sustainable and circular bioeconomy and the use of circular design principles in the built environment, new materials and innovative technologies are emerging to help reach zero-waste goals and the lowest environmental impact. Bio-fabricated materials open new avenues for reaching higher ambitions in terms of sustainability, especially if associated with high-technological solutions that can accelerate and simplify their manufacturing, retrofitting and renewal. Call objectives Bio-fabricated materials and their potential as an alternative to conventional materials are still underexplored. The widespread integration of bio-fabricated materials in the built environment faces several barriers, from technical and regulatory hurdles to high production costs, limited knowledge and expertise among construction professionals, and low acceptance by the construction ecosystem. Bio-fabricated materials and their potential as an alternative to conventional materials are underexplored. Research is required to investigate new ways to address the main technical challenges of bio-fabricated materials. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Develop and test at least two innovative sustainable bio-fabricated construction materials that: Have innovative features compared to current materials on the market (such as, but not limited to, the capacity to self-repair, to adapt to an evolving environment, to store carbon or act as a carbon sink, to heat and/or cool buildings, extended lifespan, etc.). Can be used for interior, exterior or structural purposes. Comply with relevant EU standards and regulatory frameworks. For each material developed: Assess its properties, benefits, as well as design and construction applications. This should cover at least the structural, mechanical, thermal, acoustic, health-related, durability and aesthetic properties and take into consideration the variations within a changing environment (e.g. weather conditions). Study the feasibility for mass-scale production to increase production volumes and affordability. This should consider the use of high-technological manufacturing techniques and processes (such as 3D printing, robotics, building information modelling (BIM), parametric design, high-performance sensor, artificial intelligence (AI), etc.). Analyse the environmental footprint of the bio-fabricated materials following a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to validate their contribution to the reduction of the whole life carbon emissions in the built environment. Analyse the social and economic impacts throughout the material’s whole life cycle, for example using social life-cycle assessment (SLCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC) approaches. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture or design, arts, (civil) engineering, etc.).Proposals are expected to dedicate at least 0.2% of their total budget to share their intermediate and final results and findings with the Coordination and Support Action ''New European Bauhaus hub for results and impact'' (HORIZON-MISS-2024-NEB-01-03). read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Bio-fabricated construction materials and their beneficial properties are better known and accepted by construction ecosystem professionals.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'short description The design of street furniture in neighbourhoods can have a positive impact on people''s lives by enhancing comfort, safety, well-being, health, and accessibility. It can also foster social interaction, cohesion, a sense of belonging, cultural identity and community, respect for common spaces, etc. Call objectives Infrastructural decay, unequal access to essential public amenities (e.g., seating elements, facilities for people with disabilities such as ramps and lifts, etc.) and safety concerns (e.g., related to insufficient lighting or hazardous spatial conditions) represent just some of the challenges that especially older and poorer European neighbourhoods face. Furthermore, the attention to aesthetic values in the design of street furniture can contribute to local economies by attracting new visitors (e.g. developing creative tourism) and supporting local businesses, cultural and creative sectors and industries, and social economy entities and enterprises. More prototyping and demonstration are essential to speed up the integration of innovative street furniture, that offer more attractive, sustainable, and inclusive design solutions for common spaces, following the values and principles of the New European Bauhaus. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Develop and demonstrate innovative designs for sets of street furniture which: Contribute to a functional common space throughout the year that includes relevant features such as resilience to vandalism and weather, protection from the effects of climate change, consideration of local specificities (such as coastal areas), and low maintenance cost. Improve the environmental performance of street furniture and, where relevant, integrate nature-based solutions, and sustainable, secondary (bio-based), recycled or upcycled materials as well as a digital dimension. Strengthen the aesthetic and cultural integrity of the history of the common space and the neighbourhoods. Meet the needs of different population groups throughout time (through modular and adaptive designs, and considering age, gender, mobility, etc.) by improving comfort, safety, accessibility, social interaction and well-being. Apply participatory methods while co-designing and prototyping innovative street furniture. Based on the research insights, produce recommendations to inform procurement processes for street furniture. To achieve this, project consortia may provide financial support to SMEs, education or research institutions, and other relevant actors (such as not-for profit entities) in the form of Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP).

    'short description The move towards increased renovation and the greater reuse of construction products in the built environment has created a growing interest in new business models and approaches centred on modularity, adaptability, disassembly, and sufficiency. Whereas significant research and practice has focused on the disassembly, collection, sorting, and re-processing of construction products, less attention has been directed so far to their later re-assembly. Call objectives The re-assembly stage is key for the re-integration of increasing quantities of reclaimed construction products into new applications. Concurrently, the endeavour to transform the built environment along the New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion, and beauty creates opportunities to re-think how to re-assemble reclaimed construction products safely and creatively in ways that increase the aesthetic and cultural value of buildings and infrastructures, enhancing inhabitants’ well-being and living conditions. The re-assembly of safe and sustainable reclaimed construction products requires solid knowledge of their historical uses and characteristics as well as traceability of their condition and displacement. Digital tools and technologies such as Digital Product Passports and reverse construction supply chains, following the circular economy’s cascading principle for bio-based materials and 10R-Strategies (refuse, reduce, resell/reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, recover, re-mine) for non-biobased materials, are key for the effective management, movement and reuse of safe reclaimed construction products. Local reverse construction supply chains that re-circulate safe construction products as locally as possible have the potential to maximise economic value and resource utilisation, reduce waste, pollution, energy use, procurement costs, and the environmental footprint of construction and renovation activities, and foster creativity and innovation towards greater circularity and the regeneration of social and cultural meanings in the built environment. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Explore at least one innovative approach, method, or technique to re-assemble construction products in ways that increase their embedded economic and environmental value and the aesthetic value of buildings and building ensembles by exploring existing aesthetic and cultural standards in the built environment.

    'short description The move towards increased renovation and the greater reuse of construction products in the built environment has created a growing interest in new business models and approaches centred on modularity, adaptability, disassembly, and sufficiency. Whereas significant research and practice has focused on the disassembly, collection, sorting, and re-processing of construction products, less attention has been directed so far to their later re-assembly. Call objectives The re-assembly stage is key for the re-integration of increasing quantities of reclaimed construction products into new applications. Concurrently, the endeavour to transform the built environment along the New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion, and beauty creates opportunities to re-think how to re-assemble reclaimed construction products safely and creatively in ways that increase the aesthetic and cultural value of buildings and infrastructures, enhancing inhabitants’ well-being and living conditions.

    'short description Innovative approaches are necessary to make the best use of available building technologies and construction methods to improve climate adaptability and resilience and reduce energy consumption, carbon emissions and resource use in social and affordable housing while delivering housing that is affordable, inclusive and improves well-being, in line with the European Commission’s Affordable Housing Initiative. Call objectives An increasing number of new building technologies and construction methods became available on the market in recent years that can make construction and renovation more sustainable. Current policies and regulations set ambitious standards (e.g., in terms of energy efficiency and carbon footprint), which come with higher initial investment costs, making the provision of sustainable, high-quality social and affordable housing in many European neighbourhoods a challenge. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Develop innovative approaches for the construction of new buildings and the renovation or retrofitting of existing buildings in the social and affordable housing sector. These innovative approaches must relate to how construction and renovation services are defined, procured, delivered, financed and/or managed. Define and implement in two social and affordable housing projects two ambitious packages of measures that comprise building technologies and construction methods already on the market. One package of measures must be applied to a new construction and the other to a building renovation or retrofitting. They will address all of the following: Use existing building technologies and construction methods that improve the efficiency and speed of construction and renovation or retrofitting (such as off-site construction, modular building systems, smart meters, big data analysis, sensors, and predictive maintenance). Use environmentally sustainable practices, such as nature-based solutions or carbon-storing materials to reduce energy consumption, carbon footprint, pollution, and resource use throughout the building''s life cycle while also possibly increasing buildings’ resilience and adaptability to natural, including climate change-induced, and human-made hazards. Ensure that social and affordable housing is aesthetically pleasing and contributes positively to the landscape of the place where it is located, while also respecting local context and the architectural heritage. Improve the well-being, inclusion and general living conditions of all inhabitants. For renovations or retrofitting only: minimise and mitigate, where possible, disruptions for residents and improve accessibility of buildings. Social care homes, elderly houses, and other forms of inclusive housing with residential function complemented with social welfare are also considered as eligible for development and testing of cross-cutting innovative solutions developed by the projects. To achieve this, project consortia may provide financial support to SMEs and social housing actors in the form of Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP).

    'short description This topic aims to study the interplay between cultural participation, social connections and civic engagement. The resulting insights can be used to foster and maintain the social fabric of neighbourhoods and support their green transition while addressing other challenges such as the decline in social connections. Call objectives Social connections and cultural participation are core features of individual well-being. Evidence shows a strong association between participation in cultural activities and civic behaviour (such as voting and volunteering), empathy, tolerance, security and social cohesion. Conversely, low interpersonal trust, heightened risk-taking, and disengaged civic attitudes are correlated with an increased sense of loneliness – the lack of meaningful social interactions. Cultural organisations and artistic practices with a social purpose or dimension can help to better connect people, strengthen social fabric, and overcome social boundaries. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Study the conditions under which cultural participation may reinforce the social fabric and civic engagement in neighbourhoods and contribute to the green transition: Review existing evidence and collect relevant data in a systematic, comparable way (at least in relation to some territories or dimensions) and identifying trends, gaps and correlations. Explore the wider benefits of cultural participation for individuals and communities (including those feeling left behind, all risk groups vulnerable and/or marginalised, etc.). Where possible, establish correlations, causal links, detailed descriptions, etc., depending on the proposed methodology. Provide a comprehensive analysis of relevant variables, such as socio-demographic characteristics, context-specific aspects, the presence (or absence) of meeting spaces / social infrastructure, digital literacy, local innovation capacity, polarisation, wellbeing and mental health, safety and crime, loneliness, etc. Propose at least three methods or strategies to foster and maintain the social fabric of neighbourhoods and support their green transition. These strategies, approaches or methodologies have to be guided by evidence. They are demonstrated and monitored in at least three neighbourhoods in different Member States or Associated Countries to analyse their effectiveness and their potential for sustained effects in time, in particular as regards community and civic engagement (in particular of the most marginalised and underrepresented). Based on the research evidence, propose recommendations for public authorities and not-for-profit organisations on how to facilitate cultural participation, including the skills, competencies and partnerships needed for their implementation. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, cultural operators, etc.) and disciplines. This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

    'short description This topic aims to study the interplay between cultural participation, social connections and civic engagement. The resulting insights can be used to foster and maintain the social fabric of neighbourhoods and support their green transition while addressing other challenges such as the decline in social connections. Call objectives Social connections and cultural participation are core features of individual well-being. Evidence shows a strong association between participation in cultural activities and civic behaviour (such as voting and volunteering), empathy, tolerance, security and social cohesion. Conversely, low interpersonal trust, heightened risk-taking, and disengaged civic attitudes are correlated with an increased sense of loneliness – the lack of meaningful social interactions. Cultural organisations and artistic practices with a social purpose or dimension can help to better connect people, strengthen social fabric, and overcome social boundaries. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Study the conditions under which cultural participation may reinforce the social fabric and civic engagement in neighbourhoods and contribute to the green transition: Review existing evidence and collect relevant data in a systematic, comparable way (at least in relation to some territories or dimensions) and identifying trends, gaps and correlations.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'short description In the built environment, floor space is considered as a resource. Sufficiency measures seek to optimise the use of existing (vacant and under-utilised) spaces, buildings, and infrastructures. These measures lead to an absolute reduction in demand for new-built floor space, reducing resource consumption, embodied and operational carbon emissions, and other environmental impacts in the built environment. By alleviating strain on land resources, sufficiency measures can help address social issues, such as housing shortages, and reduce infrastructure costs for municipalities. Call objectives Sufficiency is a set of policy measures and practices which reduce the demand for energy, materials, land, water, and other natural resources, while delivering well-being for all within planetary boundaries. It represents an integrated approach to sustainability and circularity, acknowledging and balancing the interplay of decarbonisation and equity. The potential of sufficiency measures in the built environment is yet under-explored due to data constraints, limited understanding of their impacts, and insufficient knowledge exchange. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Test and validate an approach to map and quantify vacant and under-utilised spaces with high sufficiency potential in the built environment. Test and validate at least two sufficiency measures that optimise, repurpose, or expand the use and functionality of space. Proposals are expected to test the proposed sufficiency measures in at least three neighbourhoods in urban, peri-urban and rural areas located in at least three Member States or Associated Countries. Quantify the potential for the proposed sufficiency measures to contribute to an absolute reduction in demand for floor space and resources (including, as a minimum, energy, raw materials, land, and water) in the built environment.

    'short description This topic supports informal networking among neighbourhoods to exchange knowledge and experiences, build their capacity, facilitate innovation in policymaking to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification – including green gentrification – that may result from interventions aligned with the New European Bauhaus. Call objectives Strategies and interventions to regenerate neighbourhoods may lead to gentrification, a process that can bring revitalization, sustainable economic growth, diversity and integration but also segregation, insecurity, exclusion, displacement, loss of cultural identity, and socio-economic inequality. Mitigating the negative consequences of gentrification cannot be achieved without policy innovation. Expected effects and impacts Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Create a bottom-up network of neighbourhoods with a (potential) risk of gentrification, to facilitate peer exchange among all relevant stakeholders. Proposals should aim for the participation of at least 15 neighbourhoods located in urban, peri-urban and rural areas from different Member States and Associated Countries. Map neighbourhoods’ needs, challenges, trends and opportunities to inform policies and interventions that mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification and of integrating the New European Bauhaus values and principles. Identify, document, and disseminate current knowledge, evidence, policy design, tools, and best practices for tackling gentrification and translate the results into useful tools that address the identified needs, challenges and opportunities. Support local decision makers in better understanding: The main drivers of gentrification (such as overtourism, interim use and short term rental markets). The effect of housing market speculation, rental agreements and (lack of) housing policies (e.g. fiscal measures, funding instruments, legislative measures) on gentrification. The effects of gentrification on different socio-demographic groups, as well as on local identities and cultural heritage. The interplay between urban, peri-urban and rural gentrification. Address the issue of gentrification in the participating neighbourhoods through at least one of the following actions: Develop or revise local policies (such as those on social/economic/urban development, housing, planning, mobility, green transition) to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification. Develop neighbourhood regeneration strategies that include measures to mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification. Proposals are expected to follow a participatory and transdisciplinary approach through the integration of different actors (such as local or regional public authorities, local actors from the targeted neighbourhoods, civil society, private owners, cultural institutions, etc.) and disciplines (such as architecture, urban design, design, arts, (civil) engineering). This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'short description This call for proposals is for Strand 2a and focuses on reinforcing the integration of innovation actors from less developed regions and transition regions in developing EU value chains while creating local opportunities for innovation and smart economic transformation in regions with shared (or complementary) smart specialisation areas. Call objectives The objective of the I3 Instrument Strand 2a call for proposals is to support interregional innovation investments by offering consortia of innovation actors from the quadruple helix ecosystems the necessary financial and advisory support to bring their innovations to a more mature level, ready for scale-up and commercialisation. The call specifically aims at reducing the innovation divide in Europe, with a strong cohesion policy focus on integrating less developed and transition regions into European value chains. Thereby, applications under this call seek to facilitate: the support of innovation actors with investment ideas that are ready to be developed into mature business cases; the identification of new regional technological domains and market opportunities with the EU priorities and bridging the gap between the supply and demand sides to help innovation ecosystems overcome market failures the creation of new value chains in less developed and transition regions and the integration into interregional and cross-border value chains with more developed regions; the application and the deployment of innovative technologies and solutions in less developed and transition regions; the interaction and collaboration of SMEs from less developed and transition regions in interregional/multi-national value chains and with innovation actors form more developed regions. The focus is on technology transfer and highly specialised advisory support for the implementation of experiments and demonstration cases in companies. Participation of innovation actors is based on shared or complementary innovation priorities, as defined in their regional and/or national smart specialisation strategies. Projects shall show a balanced participation of regions with varying levels of development and innovation performance. I3 Instrument business investment cases start with a minimum TRL 6 and have the ambition to facilitate demonstration and to accelerate market uptake and commercialisation. The development of the business and investment cases is facilitated by the regional innovation ecosystems with companies in the lead. The support to be provided shall be (a) financial support, through direct funding to consortium beneficiaries or through cascade funding/financial support to third parties (FSTP), and (b) non-financial support, such as coaching, mentoring, or matchmaking activities. At the end of the project implementation, all involved regions and partners should have a clear perspective on how to exploit and build on the I3 project results, including through the broad introduction of new products, services, or production processes. Applications under this call for proposals must address one of the following thematic priorities: Digital transition or Green transition or Smart manufacturing Each project application under this call must address one thematic priority. 1. Digital transition Digital technologies present an enormous growth potential for Europe. In line with the Europe fit for the digital age priority7, this thematic priority targets investments in businesses and public administrations (notably in the part related to the innovation sector) with regards to the digital transition. Projects will unlock the potential for digital growth, deploying innovative solutions that improve accessibility and efficiency of services (both for businesses and citizens) while bridging the digital divide and contributing to the cybersecurity. This thematic priority encourages applications in one or more or a combination of the following investment areas (non-exhaustive list): a. Digital economy innovation The deployment of innovative solutions for businesses digitalisation and digital services, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and its innovative application and/or integration into strategic sectors as per the Competitiveness Compass; ICT up-take in SMEs applied to traditional and emerging sectors; B2B; B2C; Customer to Customer, including infrastructures and services (digital innovation hubs, living labs, etc.); Demonstration of innovative digital technologies in view of the commercialisation of research results and a better integration in EU value chains; Digital skills for companies adopting innovative digital technologies (upskilling and reskilling) in the framework of investments relevant for Smart Specialisation. User driven innovation and valorisation of traceability and big data; Companies reinforcing EU cybersecurity value chain and protecting from hacking, ransomware and identity theft; Investments in innovative solutions in technology that will increase the security and resilience of communication, transport and digital networks; “Digital based” open innovation, supporting entrepreneurial discovery processes and cooperation between academia and businesses in the framework of smart specialisation; b. Digital transformation of public administration and public services New or significantly upgraded services for e-government, including the take-up of Europe wide interoperable services which improve the efficiency of services delivered by public administrations to citizens, companies and other public bodies by using information and communication technologies such as artificial intelligence; Investments in innovative solutions for cybersecurity; investments in innovative solutions helping administrations to make services user-friendly, accessible and more interoperable. Those investments might include the demonstration of the validity of new digital technologies in view of the large-scale adoption of new IT systems, e.g. technologies for digitalisation in the health care system. 2. Green transition Turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities for competitiveness in Europe is the ambition of the green transition, as outlined in the Clean Industrial Deal and the Competitiveness Compass. Both these initiatives have the goal to make Europe a resource-efficient and competitive economy, while reducing EU reliance on fossil fuels. The EU has set targets to reach climate-neutrality by 2050. This framework can drive competitiveness, as it gives certainty and predictability to companies and investors alike. This will be achieved by nurturing competitive manufacturers who drive decarbonisation through innovation, create quality jobs and contribute to our open strategic autonomy, fully respecting and applying the principle of technological neutrality for Member States as appropriate. This thematic priority intends to support innovative value chain investments, to boost our competitiveness through green technology with a focus on energy-intensive industries and the clean-tech sector as per the Clean Industrial Deal. It also intends to provide support to interregional investments in resilient and sustainable food systems and agriculture, clean energy, green industry, energy-efficient buildings and renovation, sustainable mobility and eliminating pollution. This thematic priority encourages applications in one or more or a combination of the following investment areas (non-exhaustive list): Innovative investments in decarbonisation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to improve air quality, health and well-being; Investments in circularity, including but not limited to the management of natural resources, including the use of recycled materials, especially construction materials, plastics and textiles, to stimulate demand for secondary markets raw materials; Innovative business investments related to smart, sustainable/efficient transport solutions and/or alternative fuels; Business investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency to make industry more sustainable; Business investments related to energy efficiency in buildings; Business investments related to a sustainable blue economy, contributing to the coastal protection; Business investments in circular economy to replicate and scale up successful circular economy solutions, which can generate EU added value; Investments in bioeconomy, efficient and sustainable agriculture and forestry, innovation in marine/ maritime and inland water sustainable solutions. Investments in sustainable business models and alternative modes of production and consumption (e.g. leasing, repair, modular design, industrial symbiosis…). Innovative investments in SMART cities; 3. Smart manufacturing This thematic priority focuses on improving the delivery of new or improved products, processes or services in the manufacturing industry and fostering competitiveness, strategic autonomy and a circular economy approach, as outlined in the Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal. In the context of advanced manufacturing; knowledge and innovative technologies are used to produce complex products and improve processes to lower waste, pollution, material consumption and energy use. Robotics, 3D and 4D printing, artificial intelligence as well as high performance computing for modelling are important elements in advanced manufacturing. This thematic priority supports interregional innovation investments for the uptake of new or improved manufacturing solutions, as well as for supporting industry to face the challenge of digitalisation and to promote the shift towards a more environmentally sustainable production (zero pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment). This thematic priority encourages applications in one or a combination of the following investment areas (a non-exhaustive list): Demonstration processes, i.e. helping new industrial products to reach the market faster or having more efficient and sustainable processes adopted by the industry.

Within a specific thematic/technological area of cooperation, the project portfolio might be composed of several investment-ready sub-projects that address one or several bottlenecks in a value chain identified in the application. These sub-projects are necessary to test and demonstrate the validity of technologies/solutions and accelerate innovation uptake, thus increasing the competitiveness of EU value chains. The proposal must clearly describe the progress from innovation towards commercialisation and upscaling that is expected as a result of the project and its investment portfolio. The proposal must also provide an outline of an exploitation plan that sets out the expected way forward following the completion of the project, in particular, if the new products/processes or services supported by the I3 Instrument are not yet ready for the market. Target investments can be both tangible and intangible investments in the form of one or more of the following activities: Financial support for producing plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services such as demonstrating, testing and piloting activities by companies, large-scale product validation and market replication (new to Europe and new to the application sector); Adaptation of existing prototypes (i.e., by combining two or more key enabling technologies) and tailoring them to the companies’ needs for the demonstration in a real environment (ex-novo prototyping is not eligible); Development of portfolios of projects for close-to-market investments that deploy new or improved technologies or processes; Activities directly aiming at producing plans, arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services (adaptation to the companies’ needs). This can include testing, demonstration, piloting, large-scale product validation and market replication; Activities connecting or making complementary use of testing and demonstration facilities to accelerate market uptake and scale-up of innovative solutions in shared smart specialisation areas; Innovation services for the development of the business investment interconnecting value chains; Test beds and complementary activities needed to improve regulations, standards and/or to remove barriers and bottlenecks to innovation; Activities bringing innovative ideas and new products to the market; Advisory support for investment (developing or implementing interregional business and “go to market” investment plans in specific value chains). Support actions for networking, for testing new approaches for better innovation support or for enhancing services to SMEs (through collaboration, peer-learning or matchmaking, etc.) are also encouraged, particularly when aimed at replicating project outcomes in less developed regions. These support actions will only be eligible in combination with the implementation of the tangible and intangible investment listed above. This I3 Instrument Strand 1 call for proposals will not support activities that do significant harm to environment objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. I3 funding therefore cannot be awarded to projects that do not comply with this principle (e.g. any proposal dedicated to increase the efficiency of fossil fuel technologies or of fossil fuels). Applicants will need to verify that their proposal complies with this requirement. Activities (financial and non-financial support) must reflect a balanced participation of beneficiaries from regions with varying levels of development and innovation performance, with a strong emphasis on supporting and leveraging the potential of less developed regions and other categories of regions (such as EU outermost regions or regions with specific challenges). Involvement of these regions should be reflected both in terms of balanced budget distribution and ensuring their participation results in concrete benefits for these regions. read more',

Within a specific thematic/technological area of cooperation, the project portfolio might be composed of several investment-ready sub-projects that address one or several bottlenecks in a value chain identified in the application. These sub-projects are necessary to test and demonstrate the validity of technologies/solutions and accelerate innovation uptake, thus increasing the competitiveness of EU value chains. The proposal must clearly describe the progress from innovation towards commercialisation and upscaling that is expected as a result of the project and its investment portfolio. The proposal must also provide an outline of an exploitation plan that sets out the expected way forward following the completion of the project, in particular, if the new products/processes or services supported by the I3 Instrument are not yet ready for the market. Target investments can be both tangible and intangible investments in the form of one or more of the following activities: Financial support for producing plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services such as demonstrating, testing and piloting activities by companies, large-scale product validation and market replication (new to Europe and new to the application sector); Adaptation of existing prototypes (i.e., by combining two or more key enabling technologies) and tailoring them to the companies’ needs for the demonstration in a real environment (ex-novo prototyping is not eligible); Development of portfolios of projects for close-to-market investments that deploy new or improved technologies or processes; Activities directly aiming at producing plans, arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services (adaptation to the companies’ needs). This can include testing, demonstration, piloting, large-scale product validation and market replication; Activities connecting or making complementary use of testing and demonstration facilities to accelerate market uptake and scale-up of innovative solutions in shared smart specialisation areas; Innovation services for the development of the business investment interconnecting value chains; Test beds and complementary activities needed to improve regulations, standards and/or to remove barriers and bottlenecks to innovation; Activities bringing innovative ideas and new products to the market; Advisory support for investment (developing or implementing interregional business and “go to market” investment plans in specific value chains). Support actions for networking, for testing new approaches for better innovation support or for enhancing services to SMEs (through collaboration, peer-learning or matchmaking, etc.) are also encouraged, particularly when aimed at replicating project outcomes in less developed regions. These support actions will only be eligible in combination with the implementation of the tangible and intangible investment listed above. This I3 Instrument Strand 1 call for proposals will not support activities that do significant harm to environment objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. I3 funding therefore cannot be awarded to projects that do not comply with this principle (e.g. any proposal dedicated to increase the efficiency of fossil fuel technologies or of fossil fuels). Applicants will need to verify that their proposal complies with this requirement. Activities (financial and non-financial support) must reflect a balanced participation of beneficiaries from regions with varying levels of development and innovation performance, with a strong emphasis on supporting and leveraging the potential of less developed regions and other categories of regions (such as EU outermost regions or regions with specific challenges). Involvement of these regions should be reflected both in terms of balanced budget distribution and ensuring their participation results in concrete benefits for these regions. read more',

    'short description The objective of the I3 Instrument Strand 1 call for proposals is to support interregional innovation investments by offering consortia of innovation actors from the quadruple helix ecosystems the necessary financial and advisory support to bring their innovations to a mature level, ready for commercialisation and scale-up, while bridging and reducing the innovation divide in Europe with a strong cohesion policy focus of integrating all regions and in particular the less developed regions into European value chains. Call objectives Strand 1 of the I3 instrument seeks to increase the competitiveness and the resilience of EU value chains on the basis of interregional cooperation and shared smart specialisation areas. Thereby, applications under this call seek to facilitate: the development of already existing or the creation of new interregional and cross-border value chains and a better connection between regional innovation ecosystems; the collaboration between innovation actors, especially SMEs, from less developed regions and innovation actors, especially SMEs, from more developed regions, contributing to cohesion policy objectives; the support of innovation actors with investment ideas that are ready to be developed into mature business cases; the identification of new regional technological domains and market opportunities with the EU priorities and bridging the gap between the supply and demand sides to help innovation ecosystems overcome market failures. I3 Instrument business investment cases start with a minimum TRL 6 and have the ambition to facilitate demonstration and to accelerate market uptake and commercialisation. The development of the business and investment cases is facilitated by the regional innovation ecosystems with companies in the lead. The support to be provided shall be (a) financial support, through direct funding to consortium beneficiaries or through cascade funding/financial support to third parties (FSTP), and (b) non-financial support, such as business and investment planning, protection of IPR, certification, commercialisation, standardisation, tailored support for the integration of KETs/deep tech in production processes, support in testing, demonstration and piloting new solutions. At the end of the project implementation, all involved regions and partners should have a clear perspective on how to exploit and build on the I3 project results, including through the broad introduction of new products, services, or production processes. Applications under this call for proposals must address one of the following thematic priorities: Digital transition or Green transition or Smart manufacturing Each project application under this call must address one thematic priority. 1.

    'short description Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions for improving modern information and forensic evidence analysis or frontline policing, that are not covered by topics of Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2023-2024. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2021-2022, the proposals should explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. Call objectives Proposals are expected to address one of the following options: Option a: tackling advanced technology challenges; Option b: modern forensics analysis using new and emerging technologies; Option c: modernisation of frontline policing. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. For Option b), the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of forensic institutes from EU Member States or Associated Countries is recommended. read more Expected effects and impacts The proposals funded under this topic that concern issues which are within the mandate of Europol are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. Similarly, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes. In order to ensure project impact and the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, i.e., Police Authorities and/or forensic institutes, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes: Modern, uniform and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for security practitioners (Police Authorities and forensic institutes in Europe) to prevent, detect and investigate criminal and terrorist offences, including the lawful court-proof collection of crime evidence; Improved mechanisms for cross-border information exchange in the fight against crime and terrorism, taking into account all applicable legislation and fundamental rights; Evidence-based support to policy-makers on shaping and tuning of regulation related to modern information analysis, forensic evidence analysis or frontline policing.',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaThis topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least 2 Police Authorities from at least 2 different EU Member States or Associated Countries. For these participants, applicants must fill in the table “Information about security practitioners” in the application form with all the requested information, following the template provided in the submission IT tool.

    'short description In post-conflict areas, lives of civilians are in danger and the return of economic activity is hindered because the land is contaminated by anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance. The EU provides a continuous support to humanitarian demining activities in heavily mine-affected countries and regions all over the world, thus promoting peace, security, post-conflict reconstruction, as well as social and economic rehabilitation. Call objectives In Ukraine, mine action is a critical aspect of the humanitarian emergency response, the goal of which is to support the return of the civilian population and the rebuilding of crucial civilian infrastructure. As part of their mine action operations, EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, such as Croatia, Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Armenia also strive to make their land completely free of anti-personnel mines and other explosive ordnance. Humanitarian demining is not to be confused with military demining, which is the process undertaken by soldiers to clear a safe path so they can advance during conflict. Various humanitarian demining initiatives have been developed, which often incur high costs and are typically slow because no mistakes are allowed. In addition, due to a large diversity of contaminated areas, types of anti-personnel mines and of their deployment methods, as well as a more complex contamination that includes unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices, there is no single solution to the problem. Finally, new anti-personnel mines are being developed and new mine deployment techniques being used. Therefore, new, improved, innovative or disruptive solutions, accompanied by related training curricula, are needed to enhance humanitarian demining activities in civil areas. Since the aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security, it has to be complemented by an adequate risk education, raising awareness of civilians of the risks from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance, which will help them act in such a way that will reduce the risk to people and the environment. A range of risk education initiatives exist, but they usually lack, among others, collaboration with related Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), sustainability, and a comprehensive needs assessment aiming to improve their effectiveness. Within this topic, improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners are expected, which are adapted to regional and cross-border contexts. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals should also explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU and international level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Proposals are also expected to connect and create synergies and explore complementarities with other related initiatives in humanitarian demining and in explosive ordnance risk education. Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological (humanitarian demining) and societal (explosive ordnance risk education) dimensions in a balanced way. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes. Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular Ukrainian national mine action authorities, researchers and innovators, demining agencies or companies as well as NGOs. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners involved in humanitarian demining and Unexploded Ordnance Disposal (UXO) of civil areas, taking into account all applicable legislation and fundamental rights; Improved education activities aimed at reducing risks of injuries from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance; Enhanced understanding of the key challenges and best practices related to humanitarian demining and to unexploded ordnance risk education taking into account the experience of Ukrainian participants; Evidence-based support to policy-makers on shaping of the EU mine action.',

In addition, due to a large diversity of contaminated areas, types of anti-personnel mines and of their deployment methods, as well as a more complex contamination that includes unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices, there is no single solution to the problem. Finally, new anti-personnel mines are being developed and new mine deployment techniques being used. Therefore, new, improved, innovative or disruptive solutions, accompanied by related training curricula, are needed to enhance humanitarian demining activities in civil areas. Since the aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security, it has to be complemented by an adequate risk education, raising awareness of civilians of the risks from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance, which will help them act in such a way that will reduce the risk to people and the environment. A range of risk education initiatives exist, but they usually lack, among others, collaboration with related Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), sustainability, and a comprehensive needs assessment aiming to improve their effectiveness. Within this topic, improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners are expected, which are adapted to regional and cross-border contexts. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals should also explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU and international level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Proposals are also expected to connect and create synergies and explore complementarities with other related initiatives in humanitarian demining and in explosive ordnance risk education. Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological (humanitarian demining) and societal (explosive ordnance risk education) dimensions in a balanced way. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes. Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular Ukrainian national mine action authorities, researchers and innovators, demining agencies or companies as well as NGOs. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners involved in humanitarian demining and Unexploded Ordnance Disposal (UXO) of civil areas, taking into account all applicable legislation and fundamental rights; Improved education activities aimed at reducing risks of injuries from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance; Enhanced understanding of the key challenges and best practices related to humanitarian demining and to unexploded ordnance risk education taking into account the experience of Ukrainian participants; Evidence-based support to policy-makers on shaping of the EU mine action.',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaThis topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least one international humanitarian demining organisation and two local or regional Non-Governmental Organisations active in humanitarian demining from at least three different EU Member States or Associated Countries, including Ukraine. For these participants, applicants must fill in with all the requested information, following the template provided in the submission IT tool. The participation of at least one entity from Ukraine in the consortium is mandatory with competences in humanitarian demining / Unexploded Ordnance Disposal (UXO).

    'short description The Programme is launching the second call for project platforms, under Priority 4 ‘Cooperation governance’, Programme objective 4.1 ‘Project platforms’. Call objectives Project platforms are Interreg Baltic Sea Region’s main capitalisation tool. They enable project partners to consolidate the outcomes of Interreg Baltic Sea Region projects, and integrate them with results from projects of other funding programmes. Project platforms support public authorities and relevant organisations in using consolidated project results in their work. This is how they help them govern and manage their areas more effectively. This, in turn, allows to tackle territorial challenges and influence policy improvements with greater impact. By bringing partners from Interreg Baltic Sea Region projects and other EU funded projects together, project platforms are operations of strategic importance (OSI). They provide a significant contribution to the achievement of the Programme objectives under Priority 1 Innovative societies, Priority 2 Water-smart societies, and Priority 3 Climate-neutral societies. Expected results Project platforms should contribute to one of the topics outlined below: Resilient and smart territories: to support urban and/or rural areas and their communities in applying consolidated solutions to make them more liveable, smart, and resilient environments responsive to the needs of both citizens and businesses.

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipThe partnership of a project platform should be strategically crafted, involving project partners with comprehensive knowledge of their projects’ outcomes. It should be based on partners from ongoing or recently completed Interreg Baltic Sea Region projects, and involve partners from projects of other funding programmes. Projects can be from the current (2021-2027) or previous (2014-2020) funding periods as long as they provide useful results for capitalisation. Each partner of a project platform should either represent a project with relevant outcomes or act as a representative of a knowledge multiplier, like EUSBSR policy area coordinators, pan-Baltic organisations, other international organisations, and networks of cities and regions. Project platform partners must represent at least two different projects from Interreg Baltic Sea Region and at least one project from another funding programme. It is encouraged to adopt a broader approach by involving partners from multiple projects across various funding programmes. This approach enriches the outcomes of a project platform, enhances its value for public authorities and other relevant organisations, and aligns with the strategic importance of project platforms. The project platform partnership must include at least three project partners from three different countries of the Interreg Baltic Sea Region Programme area: a lead partner and at least two project partners. At least two of the project partners have to be located in the territory of two different EU Member States in the Programme area. Given the strategic relevance of project platforms, applicants are encouraged to build partnerships that ensure a good outreach to relevant organisations in the Interreg Baltic Sea Region Programme area. As a general rule, organisations located in the regions belonging to the Programme area can become project partners. In exceptional cases, organisations from outside the Programme area can also apply as project partners. The partnership builds on the lead partner principle, requiring each project platform to designate a lead partner responsible for preparing and submitting the application. The lead partner should be a partner organisation from an Interreg Baltic Sea Region project or an EUSBSR policy area coordinator. Lead partners must fall into the legal status category “public” defined in the Programme Manual (chapter C.2.1). When involving project partners from other funding programmes, project platforms are encouraged to consider the following programmes: various Interreg programmes (inter alia, Central Baltic, South Baltic, Germany-Denmark, Aurora, Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak, Estonia-Latvia, Latvia-Lithuania, Lithuania-Poland, Sweden-Norway, Northern Periphery and Arctic, North Sea Region, Central Europe, Interreg Europe), as well as other EU funding programmes like Horizon Europe, LIFE, national and regional programmes under the ESF+ and ERDF, and instruments run by regional organisations such as the Council of the Baltic Sea States and the Swedish Institute. Additionally, project platforms are encouraged to involve other important stakeholders as associated organisations. other eligibility criteriaThe Programme area covers nine countries. It comprises the following EU Member States: Denmark: the whole country Estonia: the whole country Finland: the whole country Germany: the States (Länder) of Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Schleswig-Holstein and Niedersachsen (only NUTS II area Lüneburg region) Latvia: the whole country Lithuania: the whole country Poland: the whole country Sweden: the whole country In addition, a third country takes part in the Programme: Norway: the Regions of Trøndelag, Møre og Romsdal, Vestland, Rogaland, Agder, Vestfold og Telemark, Viken, Innlandet, Oslo',

    'short description The uptake of innovation stemming from EU-funded security research is not a single-step process, and there is no single method of ensuring the market uptake of successful research results. Innovation uptake needs to be contemplated as a long process that is conditioned by a number of enabling actions to be taken before research is even planned and long after it is completed. However, market uptake and deployment of innovation by security practitioners are recurrent challenges in civil security research. Call objectives The EU-funded security research ecosystem has changed the traditional relationship between practitioners and solution providers. The awareness of security needs and solutions has been steadily growing at all levels during the last years, with EU funded security research and innovation projects playing a pivotal role. This awareness guarantees not only that research addresses critical needs, but also that the research investment will deliver tangible results. There are several approaches to achieve a better market uptake and to ensure that innovation can pass from the realm of research to the realm of the market and eventually innovative tools to be used by security practitioners. In order to support SMEs and start-ups but also practitioners to find the avenues of uptake of innovation, models and methods for transferring research to the market should be promoted. This topic aims to offer services and guidance to entities in the security ecosystem to achieve market uptake. The services should be delivered to SMEs/Start-ups and Practitioners. Therefore, there would be Supply-oriented Services and Demand-oriented services. Some of the expected services could be open for the whole community (e.g., material online) and examples of good practices, whereas others would be provided upon specific request by an entity (on demand services). On demand services may be linked to other EU-funded actions but should not cover activities already funded from those in order to avoid double funding. Applicants should be able to demonstrate a proven experience in technology development and innovation in the area of security and deep knowledge on the security ecosystem. Successful candidates should be able to provide services such as: Funding & procurement guidance Market research / competitive landscaping / Marketplaces / Market surveys/consultations Proof of concept development (for TRL 2-4) Funding and tendering observatory Investor search / venture building Technology validation support Lab testing support (i.e., Readiness assessment, Artificial Intelligence act compliance, Machine Learning security, Ethical Legal and Societal assessment, High Performance Computing capabilities, Synthetic data generation, Access to Datasets, stress testing etc.) Tech and/or entrepreneurial skills development (training) read more Expected effects and impacts The proposals should outline the methods and processes by which they intend to decide which organisations they provide support to, respecting principles such as transparency, equal treatment, non-discrimination between organisations and effectiveness (impact). The project should provide suggestions for such methods and processes as deliverable to be approved by the European Commission. The applicants submitting the proposals have to ensure sufficient representativeness of the communities of interest (including, but not only, geographical representativeness) and a balanced coverage in terms of knowledge and skills of the different knowledge domains required to face the challenge, including security operations, technologies, research & innovation, industry, market, etc. The applying consortia need to demonstrate that the project beneficiaries guarantee the expertise required to steer the project activities in all the knowledge domains to ensure the success of the action. The work of the partners has to be supported by solid and recognised tools and methods, also accompanied by the required expertise to put them in practice. Proposals should take into account the work initiated by the Networks of Practitioners funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes and the ongoing work of Knowledge Networks. Proposals should build to the extent possible on the outcomes of previous initiatives that foster innovation uptake (e.g., iProcureNet, Multirate, etc). In addition, existing initiatives like Horizon Booster, EACTDA and EAFIP have some components which could be used by the successful project and to be adapted in the area of security. The project has to identify and describe options for the sustainability of the services beyond the project lifetime, including the setting up of a permanent scheme which will continue to offer the proposed services to the community as a self-sustainable mechanism. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. The provision of financial support to third parties in the form of grants is optional. read more Expected results Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: To offer advanced services on innovation uptake to the security community; To provide a self-sustained mechanism for advanced advisory and support services, to act as a market catalyst; and to accelerate the uptake of innovation for security; Enhanced cooperation between research institutions, smaller private research agencies, security practitioners, Start-ups and SMEs to support innovation uptake; Strengthening the technology transfer from research to the market and strengthening of security ecosystem.

The applicants submitting the proposals have to ensure sufficient representativeness of the communities of interest (including, but not only, geographical representativeness) and a balanced coverage in terms of knowledge and skills of the different knowledge domains required to face the challenge, including security operations, technologies, research & innovation, industry, market, etc. The applying consortia need to demonstrate that the project beneficiaries guarantee the expertise required to steer the project activities in all the knowledge domains to ensure the success of the action. The work of the partners has to be supported by solid and recognised tools and methods, also accompanied by the required expertise to put them in practice. Proposals should take into account the work initiated by the Networks of Practitioners funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes and the ongoing work of Knowledge Networks. Proposals should build to the extent possible on the outcomes of previous initiatives that foster innovation uptake (e.g., iProcureNet, Multirate, etc). In addition, existing initiatives like Horizon Booster, EACTDA and EAFIP have some components which could be used by the successful project and to be adapted in the area of security. The project has to identify and describe options for the sustainability of the services beyond the project lifetime, including the setting up of a permanent scheme which will continue to offer the proposed services to the community as a self-sustainable mechanism. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. The provision of financial support to third parties in the form of grants is optional. read more Expected results Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: To offer advanced services on innovation uptake to the security community; To provide a self-sustained mechanism for advanced advisory and support services, to act as a market catalyst; and to accelerate the uptake of innovation for security; Enhanced cooperation between research institutions, smaller private research agencies, security practitioners, Start-ups and SMEs to support innovation uptake; Strengthening the technology transfer from research to the market and strengthening of security ecosystem.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaParticipation as beneficiaries of at least 2 Research and Technology Organisations is required.',

    'short description The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) tools is increasingly at the core of first responder’s decision-making processes, including situational awareness, analysis and planning. Besides the needs to develop AI and ML tools, ground technologies such as miniaturised sensors that can operate autonomously for a long period in harsh environments and are fast and easy to deploy are needed for threat detection (such as chemical, biological or radiological substances) and/or identification of victims and possible locations for intervention. Call objectives Responders need to exchange information (language, data, video, etc.) in a reliable, secure, and universal way, while emergency communications throughout the European Union also need to be strengthened. In many instances, interoperability of tools, technologies and communication channels is still an open issue, requiring standard operating procedures, specific education, training and exercises of responders. The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to testing / validate tools, technologies and data used in cross-border prevention, preparedness and responses to climate / geological / accidental fire disasters and chemical, biological or radiological emergency threats (including medical countermeasures) by different practitioner’s sectors in view of demonstrating their interoperability in real-case situations, with focus on the use of AI and ML tools, miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification, and communication (including cross-border emergency communications). Proposals are expected to address one of the following options focused on testing / validation of tools and technologies, and demonstration of their interoperability: Option a: Use of artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) tools to support first responder’s analysis, planning and decision-making; Option b: Miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification; Option c: Information exchange / Communication among first responders in a reliable, secure and universal way, and cross-border emergency communications; Option d: Alert system to detect CBRN threats, integrating different systems at national, regional and European levels. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage beyond the project consortium with disaster management authorities, Industry/SMEs and Standardisation Organisations during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the Disaster Risk Reduction community. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant practitioners, i.e., First Responders with expertise in the different types of natural or human-made threats, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. Proposals that include solutions and/or methods that would contribute to a lower environmental impact and footprint, better cost-efficiency, better energy-efficiency, and/or better operational autonomy of the capabilities and solutions in this topic, would be welcome. Proposals should plan their activities opting for the Financial Support to Third Parties in order to provide financial support to practitioners (first responders / disaster management authorities) for expanding the proposed work in terms of additional user groups, complementary assessments, technology- or methodology-testing activities and/or to SMEs as additional solution providers.

    'short description Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions for improving the prevention, detection and deterrence of various forms of crime or terrorism/radicalisation through an enhanced understanding of the related societal issues. Call objectives Proposals are expected to address one of the following options: Option a: societal issues related to crime; Option b: societal issues related to terrorism and radicalisation. These challenges and/or solutions should not be covered by topics of Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2023-2024. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. The same applies regarding Horizon Europe projects under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-05: Evolution of political extremism, and HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-05: Gender-roles in extremist movements. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. read more Expected effects and impacts The proposals funded under this topic that concern issues which are within the mandate of Europol are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. Similarly, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes. If the funded proposal concerns radicalisation, the consortium is encouraged to liaise with the EU Knowledge Hub on prevention of radicalisation with the aim of facilitating the streamlining of their priorities and the dissemination of their results. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, i.e., Police Authorities and Non-Governmental Organisations / Civil Society Organisations, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project. Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological and societal dimensions of the tackled challenge in a balanced way. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities. Proposals should plan their activities opting for the Financial Support to Third Parties in order to provide financial support to practitioners (Police Authorities and/or Non-Governmental Organisations/Civil Society Organisations) for expanding the proposed work in terms of additional user groups, complementary assessments, technology- or methodology-testing activities. From 5% up to 20% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties. Proposals must clearly describe the objectives and the expected results to be obtained, including the elements listed in the application template. Proposals are also expected to describe the methods and processes relevant to comply with the general eligibility conditions for financial support to third parties set out in General Annex B and to demonstrate effectiveness (impact). read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes: Improved, modern, uniform and validated tools, skills or methodologies as well as innovative training curricula for security practitioners (Police Authorities, Non-Governmental Organisations, Civil Society Organisations) in Europe, to prevent, detect and deter criminal or terrorist offences, taking into account all applicable legislation and fundamental rights; Enhanced understanding of the cultural and societal aspects of crime or terrorism/radicalisation, as well as on the key challenges related to combating them; Evidence-based support to policymakers on shaping and tuning of regulation related to crime or terrorism/radicalisation; Enhanced perception by citizens that Europe is an area of freedom, security and justice, fully respecting privacy and human rights, thanks to, e.g., innovative awareness-raising campaigns explaining to citizens the key and evolving mechanisms of crime or terrorism/radicalisation, and how to protect against them. read more',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaThis topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least 1 Police Authority and at least 1 Civil Society Organisation, CSO (or Non-Governmental Organisation, NGO) from at least 2 different EU Member States or Associated Countries. For these participants, applicants must fill in the table “Information about security practitioners” in the application form with all the requested information, following the template provided in the submission IT tool.

External border areas, pre-frontier areas as well as contexts and scenarios in Europe’s border regions that may in the future be impacted by geopolitical instabilities, hybrid threats, or tensions from outside the EU, and need sustained and improved surveillance and reaction capabilities, could be particularly considered. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Effective Management of EU External Borders 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. Call objectives Proposals may address capabilities of information exchange, capabilities for detection of illegal activities, and/or solutions that can be deployed efficiently across diverse geographical regions; capabilities for operational event data recording; capabilities to detect irregular activities in areas of terminals for travel (air, sea) or logistics terminals around a Border Control Point, without disrupting the flow of operations; capabilities that support and help the decision-making process and facilitate operating in different scenarios (air, sea, land) simultaneously. The EBCG Capability Roadmap recognises that future surveillance capabilities that help detect cross-border irregularities and cases requiring Search and Rescue activities are essential. Solutions should be modular and scalable to cater to the regional and challenges specificities. Examples of technologies and solutions that may be relevant for this topic include but are not limited to: sensing (at tactical, operational, and/or strategic levels), autonomous platforms, vehicles and systems (aerial, ground, surface or underwater, vessel-based or not, mobile or land-borne, etc); interconnectivity between sensors and platforms and automated data fusion; data processing systems; image and signal processing and analysis; robotics; computing technologies including edge and cloud computing; decision-support systems and human-machine interfaces. Projects should integrate: perspectives of safeguarding and promoting human rights, including gender equality, developing solutions that contribute to those safeguarding and promotion; inputs from human rights, law and ethical perspectives, as well as the consideration and views of individuals and society, as well as a gender sensitive approach, as appropriate; proposals can engage with civil society organisations for wider input and support; aspects of cybersecurity of the technology proposed, and the protection of communication systems and networks involved in the solutions, if and as relevant. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals that include solutions and/or methods that would contribute to a lower environmental impact and footprint, better cost-efficiency, better energy-efficiency, and/or better operational autonomy of the capabilities and solutions in this topic, would be welcome.

Call objectives If proposals are related to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaSubject to restrictions for the protection of European communication networks. This topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least 3 Police Authorities from at least 3 different EU Member States or Associated Countries.

    'short description End-users and public procurers from several countries are invited to submit proposals for a preparatory action that should build the grounds for a future Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) action. Both this preparatory action and the future PCP action are open to proposals oriented to the acquisition of Research and Development (R&D) services for the development of innovative technologies, systems, tools or techniques to enhance border security, to fight against crime and terrorism, to protect infrastructure and public spaces, and/or to make societies more resilient against natural or human-made disasters. Call objectives In preparing the grounds for a possible future PCP action, the outputs of this Coordination and Support Action (CSA) should take into consideration: The policy priorities described in this Work Programme Part for the security areas mentioned above; The EU Directive for public procurement and in particular with the provisions related to PCP; The specific provisions and funding rates of PCP actions and the specific requirements for innovation procurement (PCP/PPI) supported by Horizon Europe grants, as stated in the General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme; The guidance for attracting innovators and innovation, as explained in the European Commission Guidance on Innovation Procurement C(2021) 4320, in particular those measures oriented to reduce the barriers to high-tech start-ups and innovative SMEs. Expected effects and impacts During the course of the project, the applicants are expected to deliver clear evidence on a number of aspects in order to justify and de-risk a possible follow-up PCP action, including: That the challenge is pertinent and that indeed a PCP action is required to complete the maturation cycle of certain technologies and to compare different alternatives; That there is a consolidated group of potential buyers with common needs and requirements which are committed to carry out a PCP action in order to be able to take an informed decision on a future joint procurement of innovative solutions; That there is a quantifiable and identifiable community of potential buyers (including and beyond those proposed as beneficiaries in the proposal) who would share to a wide extent the common needs and requirements defined and who could be interested in exploring further joint-uptake of solutions similar to those developed under the PCP, should these prove to be technologically mature and operationally relevant by the end of the project; That the state of the art and the market (including research) has been explored and mapped, and that there are different technical alternatives to address the proposed challenge; That a future PCP tendering process is clear, that a draft planning has been proposed and that the supporting documentation and administrative procedures will be ready on due time in order to launch the call for the acquisition of R&D services according to the PCP rules; That the technology developments to be conducted in the future PCP can be done in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data; That in developing technology solutions, societal and gender aspects (e.g., perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) can be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner. If the applicants intend to submit a proposal for a follow-up PCP in a future Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme, they should ensure that the above evidence is consolidated in the project deliverables of this CSA before the submission of the PCP proposal. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. read more Expected results Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Consolidated demand for innovative security technologies built on the aggregation of public buyers with a common need expressed in functional and/or operational terms without prescribing technical solutions; Better informed decision-making related to investment in innovative security technologies based on a better understanding of the potential EU-based supply of technical alternatives that could address common needs of EU public buyers; Better informed decision-making related to investment in innovative security technologies based on an improved visibility of the potential demand in the EU market for common security technologies; Increased capacity of EU public procurers to align requirements with industry and future products and to attract innovation and innovators from security and other sectors through common validation strategies, rapid innovation, experimentation and pre-commercial procurement; Increased innovation capacity of EU public procurers through the availability of innovative tendering guidance, commonly agreed validation strategies and evidence-based prospects of further joint procurement of common security solutions. read more',

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipTo be eligible for funding, applicants must be established in one of the following countries: the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows: at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries. Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaThis topic requires the participation, as beneficiaries, of at least 6 end-user organisations as well as at least 3 public procurers. One beneficiary can have the role of end-user and public procurer simultaneously, both counting towards the number of such entities required for the additional eligibility condition. These beneficiaries must be from at least 3 different EU Member States or Associated Countries. For these participants, applicants must fill in the table “Information about security practitioners” in the application form with all the requested information, following the template provided in the submission IT tool. Open market consultations carried out during this project must take place in at least three EU Member States or Associated Countries.',

    'short description The underlying idea of this topic is to avoid that security and disaster risk research projects obtain and prepare data that at the end of the projects is simply lost instead of being stored and shared for reuse. Call objectives In the security domain, due to its specificities, the special categories of data involved or/and unique limitations, which may call for additional requirements, a consolidated, common research database is particularly desired. It is of utmost importance that security practitioners are provided with an increased interoperability and improved (cross-border) exchange of data thanks to harmonised data file formats across Europe, which would easily take into account technological evolutions, i.e., be adaptable in time. Such a lack of realistic, up-to-date and sufficient training and testing data for research purposes and consequently the need for a database, data repository or any other effective and useful tool(s) to gather, manage and store varying security research data, have been regularly raised by the projects working in the area of security. The same is true of data on disaster risk management where national or regional analysis and forecasting databases or national disaster risk assessments can be fragmented or sealed without reasonable open, sustainable access to the wider community. As a follow up of the outcomes and results of the LAGO project coming from the 2021 data topic: HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-04: Improved access to fighting crime and terrorism research data, the successful proposal, should subsequently focus on creation and deployment of a fully functional and operational common research data repository, which will extend to cover other security research areas. The LAGO project is currently developing the skeleton of how such a repository of R&I data should be created, by providing a detailed roadmap consisting of a clear set of rules, conditions and characteristics that such a consolidated database should have. This LAGO roadmap will provide technical, legal and ethical requirements for a training and testing research data repository mostly in the area of fighting crime and terrorism, but the same project will already take into account possible applications of identified solutions in different security research domains, such as infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience. The LAGO roadmap will also assess if the repository should be centralised or distributed, how to deal with "aging" data, how efficiently projects should exchange data among them taking into account security R&I specificities. Building on the skeleton of LAGO, the newly developed data repository will enable security community (researchers, practitioners, industry, policy makers) access the scientifically satisfactory amount of up-to-date high quality and realistic data which is or was used to develop reliable (mostly digital and based on AI but also non-digital and not linked with big data) tools, technologies and solutions in support of security research and innovation. This data repository could also be very useful for verification and validation of new innovative security solutions developed under various calls in the most recent Work Programme. Taking into account the complexity of the future repository, a multi-faceted approach will be needed and the proposal, apart from the roadmap’s findings developed by LAGO, should also build on, and not duplicate, LAGO’s outcomes regarding the following aspects: What exact types of data should be stored in the repository; Interoperability with existing operational systems; Interoperability/compatibility with European open science cloud (EOSC), with the TESSERA project as well as other potentially relevant architectures and initiatives such as European Data Spaces or GAIA-X; How to search for data; Data models for security research - Harmonising of data formats; Concept of operations for the use of the repository by/during EU-funded security R&I projects, modalities of use, user profiles/schemes, etc. Legal issues, avoidance of any bias, accessibility levels related to the sensitivity of various data sets, solutions for annotation as well as for the aging of the data, etc. read more Expected effects and impacts The proposal should carry out extensive testing and evaluation (verification and validation), in close cooperation with ongoing projects, which would access the repository, populate it and use data intensively during the project implementation. The proposal should develop an exploitation and sustainability plan following up the planning activities of LAGO, including funding instruments to be used for the operationalisation of the repository developed under the project as well as finding possibilities to maintain the repository after the lifetime of the project so that it not only continues to well function but is able to be extended with new data. The data repository will need to grow so it will have to be treated as an ongoing system. Co-ordination with already existing platforms or communities already using another reliable domain-specific data repository/ies for archiving and sharing research data is strongly recommended in order to verify if it would be possible to adhere in the future to a larger system or infrastructure of repositories such as European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) for example and other relevant activities. Adopting sound security practices, such as developing comprehensive access rules to allow only authorized users with a legitimate need to access, modify, or transmit data, are crucial. Combined with a digital signature approach or multi-factor authentication, access rules go a long way in keeping sensitive data stored in a data repository secure. These and other security measures, such as the anonymisation of personal data, will enable the research community to fully leverage large volumes of data without introducing unnecessary security risks. The repository developed by the proposal should preserve research data relevant to various security research domains, such as fighting crime and terrorism, infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience across time and help security research community easily find, access and re-use the necessary data. The development and the functioning of the repository will be based on the outcomes of the roadmap from the LAGO project from 2021 FCT call project within the remits of Horizon Europe regulation (including ethics). The repository should be operational to be tested for at least one year before the project ends. Data sharing will be based on open science principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). To make data FAIR, the basics of good Research Data Management will have to be applied. All necessary system features as well as the functioning of the repository should comply with privacy and data protection requirements when handling data, in order to facilitate data management ensuring full access to the data actually needed (in line with the necessity and proportionality principle and in full respect of fundamental rights and applicable legislation. Projects should take into account, during their lifetime, relevant activities and initiatives for ensuring and improving the quality of scientific software and code, such as those resulting from projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02 on the development of community-based approaches.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'short description This call supports innovative SMEs in developing mature digital security technologies aligned with EU civil security priorities. It fosters collaboration between small tech actors, end-users, and larger players to boost innovation uptake, market access, and reduce EU dependency on non-EU technologies. Call objectives Europe’s 25 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy. SMEs can bring innovation to societal challenges, including the security of EU citizens. Innovative SMEs and high-tech start-ups can transform and modernise EU security capabilities. However, despite the innovation capacity of EU SMEs, these often experience difficulties in finding their way to the public markets. These include red tape in public contracts, access to new customers, access to finance, industrial competition and IP valorisation. These difficulties are exacerbated in markets that show restrictions of different kind, as it is the case of security. Knowing that SMEs require additional support to reach the security buyers and that the collaboration opportunities offered by the projects of the Pillar II of Horizon Europe can be a catalyst for uptake, this topic aims to offer a collaborative environment for small and medium innovators to tailor their innovations to the specific needs of civil security end-users. Applicants are invited to submit proposals for technology development along with the following principles: Focus on mature digital technological solutions aligned with STEP guidance addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 Work Programme; Fostering collaboration between SMEs from different Member States and Associated Countries; Involving security end-users in the role of validator and potential first-adopter of the proposed innovations; Fostering collaboration schemes between small companies and research and technology organisations and/or big industrial players aimed at fostering innovative technology transfer or creating innovative business models that facilitate access to market and strengthen the innovation capacity of EU SMEs and start-ups in the domain of civil security. Examples of activities to plan in the proposed projects include, but are not limited to: assimilating market requirements; facilitating access to additional funding; approaching potential public buyers; assess competitive landscape; supporting in innovation management (methodological and process innovation, business model innovation, market innovation); assist in IP management and exploitation; provide guidance for expansion to future markets, etc. The participation of research and technology organisations should not focus on own technology development but on supporting the small industrial players in accelerating the technology transfer of innovative security solutions for their further development and production. It is encouraged that one SME takes the coordinator role. Exceptions to this requirement should be duly justified. This topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) and addresses civil security technologies falling under the sectors of “Digital technologies and deep-tech innovation. This topic contributes to the objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, i.e., to boost investment in critical technologies in Europe, and, to contribute to reducing or preventing the strategic dependencies of the Union. read more Expected results Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Development of a mature technological solution addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 work programme and in particular the destination of fighting crime and terrorism, disaster resilient societies, border management and resilient infrastructure.

    'short description Improved risk governance, adaptation and resilience requires authorities and communities to adopt risk and resilience management approaches, which are inclusive and innovative, through pre-defined plans and procedures, as well as through adaptable and flexible capabilities to prepare for, respond to, recover from and learn from disasters and crises. It requires the implementation of policies at different levels (international to regional and/or local) and strategies for a better understanding of impacts and enhanced risk preparedness and adaptation, which are co-developed and enabled through all-of-society engagement and participation, and hence strengthen resilience to disasters among authorities, decision-makers, private actors, intermediary actors, volunteers and citizens, and the most vulnerable. Call objectives The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions for an enhanced understanding of impacts of disasters and crises linked to natural or human-made causes on risk governance and improved resilience of emergency systems, that are not covered by topics of Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2023-2024. If they related to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. Proposals are expected to address one of the following options: Option a: Enhanced impact forecasting and early warning systems, understanding of climate / weather extreme events and geohazards and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention and preparedness; Option b: Enhanced impact forecasting and understanding of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive (CBRN-E) threats and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention preparedness and response (including medical countermeasures). Projects do not need to address all elements of CBRN-E. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage beyond the project consortium with volunteers'' organisations, regional and/or local authorities and disaster management authorities during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the Disaster Risk Reduction community. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant practitioners, i.e., emergency responders (with expertise in the different types of natural or human-made threats), proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes. Due to the scope of this topic, legal entities established in LAC (Latin America and Caribbean), African, and Central Asian countries are encouraged to participate. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome(s): Better understanding of the impact of disasters and crises, and improved early warnings and long-term planning linked to natural causes or to human-made threats (including CBRN) on risk governance, including emergency services, regional and/or local authorities, and citizen volunteers, and improved adaptation and resilience of emergency systems for disaster prevention and preparedness – especially in a multi-risk environment with cascading disasters.',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaDue to the scope of this topic, legal entities established in LAC (Latin America/African/Caribbean) as well as Central Asian Countries are exceptionally eligible for Union funding. This topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least 2 Regional and/or Local Authorities, 1 disaster management authority and 1 Volunteers Organisation from at least 3 different EU Member States or Associated Countries. For these participants, applicants must fill in the table “Information about security practitioners” in the application Procedure Legal and financial set-up of the Grant Agreements form with all the requested information, following the template provided in the submission IT tool.

As a result, anyone may become more vulnerable if barriers to these processes occur. Call objectives Strengthening societal resilience to disasters requires investment by authorities at operational, strategic, and policy levels to improve engagement with citizens and integrate inclusive communication processes. In order to achieve this, it is important to take into account the diversity of citizens, be it relating to age, gender, educational levels, disability, and other social characteristics. The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, participation in this topic is limited to legal entities established in Member States and Associated Countries and OECD countries. In order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, shall not participate in the action.',

    'short description Conflicts such as the Russian war against Ukraine and the overall geopolitical context marked by tensions and conflicts make it more pressing than ever to ensure that responders are equipped with advanced tools that not only enhance their capabilities, but also protect their lives and increase operational efficiency in extreme environments. These crises demand a new level of preparedness and resilience, where autonomous systems using cutting-edge technologies work in unison to support swift, coordinated, and safe responses. Call objectives In light of the ongoing conflicts and the complex, high-risk environments they present, this topic focuses on developing and deploying advanced autonomous systems specifically tailored for large-scale, multi-dimensional disasters and tailored to the challenges of conflict driven. These disasters, exacerbated by geopolitical conflict, severe infrastructure damage, and immediate safety threats to both civilians and responders, demand innovative and resilient solutions. The topic seeks to address the EU’s critical need for tools that protect infrastructure, services, and populations while enhancing resilience and operational readiness. Through rigorous real-world testing and capacity-building programs, responders will be trained to integrate and manage these autonomous systems effectively, preparing them for rapid deployment in high-stakes scenarios. The project will focus on delivering innovative, durable, and efficient technological solutions that allow responding effectively to crises similar in complexity and danger in environments similar to the one of the war in Ukraine. By developing tools that address the unique operational and safety challenges posed by such scenarios, this topic will reinforce the EU’s preparedness to protect both citizens and first responders, ensuring swift, coordinated responses to complex crises across Europe and beyond. Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular researchers and innovators previously active in Ukraine as well as Ukrainian researchers and innovators who are unable to return to Ukraine in the given circumstances. read more Expected results Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: To develop and/or adapt a Multi-Function Autonomous Systems for High-Risk Scenarios, which can navigate the unique challenges posed by conflict-driven disasters, such as unstable structures and heavily obstructed urban environments. This system will perform or support civilian tasks like search and rescue, hazard assessment, and supply transport in areas too dangerous for human responders; Enhanced remote sensing and situational awareness, creating sensor-based technologies that improve situational awareness for first responders and decision-makers, enabling them to assess disaster zones remotely and safely; Autonomous navigation and search capabilities in dangerous environments focusing on technologies that enhance the ability of autonomous systems to perform search operations in low-visibility or smoky conditions, typical of areas impacted by bombings, fires, or other conflict-related incidents; User-centred and real-world testing in environments that replicate the conditions of conflict zones and urban disasters; Capacity building and training for autonomous system deployment providing specialised training guidelines for first responders and civil protection agencies to operate and maintain autonomous systems effectively in conflict scenarios. read more',

University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipTo be eligible for funding, applicants must be established in one of the following countries: the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows: at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries. Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaThis topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least three first responders’ organisations or agencies from at least three different EU Member States or Associated Countries, including Ukraine. For these participants, applicants must fill in the table “Information about security practitioners” in the application form with all the requested information, following the template provided in the submission IT tool. The participation of at least one entity from Ukraine in the consortium is mandatory. If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may additionally be used).',

Understanding all implications for cybersecurity requires deeper analysis and further research and innovation. Call objectives Generative AI presents both opportunities and challenges in the field of cybersecurity. This topic supports the research on new opportunities brought by Generative AI for Cybersecurity applications, to develop, train and test AI models to scale up detection of threats and vulnerabilities, enhance response time, cope with the large quantities of data involved, and automate process and decision-making support; for example by generating reports from threat intelligence data, suggesting and writing detection rules, threat hunts, and queries for the Security information and event management (SIEM), creating management, audit and compliance reports and reverse engineering malware. Proposals addressing expected outcome 1 (see below) Advanced threat and anomaly detection and analysis: Current cybersecurity tools may struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics of cyber attackers. Developing, training and testing of Generative AI models can be used to analyse large volumes of data and accurately identify anomalies and deviations from normal patterns of behaviour, enabling more effective threat detection, analysis and response. Tools should also support cybersecurity professionals as they may struggle to detect and respond to threats posed by generative AI, particularly as these systems become more sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from genuine human activity. Adaptive security measures: Cybersecurity tools often rely on static rules and signatures to detect threats, making them less effective against new and evolving attack methods. In addition, many cybersecurity tools still rely on manual intervention for threat response, which can be time-consuming and ineffective. Generative AI, through development, training, finetuning and testing of Generative AI models can support these tools to adapt and respond to emerging threats in real-time, improving overall security posture. Enhanced authentication and access control: The use of AI technologies could improve resilience of authentication and access control systems to unauthorized access and credential theft, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information or systems.

University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipTo be eligible for funding, applicants must be established in one of the following countries: the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows: at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries. Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteria In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, participation in this topic is limited to legal entities established in Member States and Associated Countries. In order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, shall not participate in the action.',

Public administrations, companies and citizens are more interconnected and interdependent across sectors and borders than ever before. This higher uptake of digital technologies increases exposure to cyber security incidents, vulnerabilities and their potential impacts. At the same time, Member States are facing growing cybersecurity risks and an overall complex threat landscape, with a clear risk of rapid spill-over of cyber incidents from one Member State to others. Moreover, cyber operations are increasingly integrated in hybrid and warfare strategies, with significant effects on the target. In particular, the current geopolitical context is being accompanied by a strategy of hostile cyber operations, which is a game changer for the perception and assessment of the EU’s collective cybersecurity crisis management preparedness and a call for urgent action. The threat of a possible large-scale incident causing significant disruption and damage to critical infrastructure and data spaces demands heightened preparedness at all levels of the EU’s cybersecurity ecosystem. In recent years, the number of cyberattacks has increased dramatically, including supply chain attacks aiming at cyberespionage, ransomware, or disruption. The vulnerability landscape is also threatening. The ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2024 counts a total of 19,754 vulnerabilities. This amount of vulnerabilities can’t be manually managed by humans. There is a need for automated management of vulnerabilities based on established standards like the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). As regards detection of cyber threats and incidents, there is an urgent need to increase the exchange of information and improve our collective capabilities in order to reduce drastically the time needed to detect cyber threats and mitigate, before they can cause large-scale damage and costs. While many cybersecurity threats and incidents have a potential cross-border dimension, due to the interconnection of digital infrastructures, the sharing of relevant information among Member States remains limited. Proposals are expected to address this emerging threat landscape with the development of advanced frameworks, services tools, and processes, in line with relevant EU legislation (NIS2, Cyber Resilience Act, Cyber Solidarity Act). Lastly, focus should be given to developing innovative frameworks, technologies, tools, processes, and services that reinforce cybersecurity capabilities for operational and technical cybersecurity cooperation, in line with relevant EU policy, with particular focus on NIS2, Cyber Solidarity Act and the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, as well as legal and ethical requirements. Proposals should address at least two of the following expected outcomes: Enhanced Situational Awareness through advanced Cyber Threat Intelligence frameworks, tools, and services as well as cybersecurity risk assessments of critical supply chains made in the EU, Frameworks, tools, and services for preparedness against Cyber and Hybrid Threats in information and communication technology (ICT) and operational technology (OT), including cybersecurity exercises, Expanded Security Operations Centre/Computer Security Incident Response Teams (SOC/CSIRT) functionality through advanced tools and services for detection, analysis, incident handling including response and reporting as well as remediation, Development of testing and experimentation facilities for advanced tools and processes for operational cybersecurity, including the creation of digital twins for critical infrastructures and essential and important entities as defined in NIS2, Development and pilot implementation of cross-sector and/or cross-border cyber crisis management frameworks, services, and tools, Frameworks, services, and tools aimed at mechanisms and processes for enhanced operational cooperation between public sector entities (CSIRT network, EU-CyCLONe).

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, participation in this topic is limited to legal entities established in Member States and Associated Countries. In order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, shall not participate in the action.',

    'short description The National Coordination Centres (NCCs) set up by the Regulation (EU) 2021/887 are designed to work together through a network and to contribute to achieving the objectives of the regulation and to foster the Cybersecurity Competence Community in each Member State, by contributing to the acquisition of the necessary capacity. National Coordination Centres can also support priority areas such as the implementation of EU legislation (Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the proposed Cyber Resilience Act and the Cybersecurity Act). Call objectives The objective of this topic is to support the operation of the NCCs and to enable them to support the cybersecurity community, including SMEs, for the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions and strengthen cybersecurity capacities. This could also be achieved by using Financial Support for Third Parties (FSTPs). Based on the financing received in previous years and on the different operational start dates in the Member States, this activity aims to continue providing support for NCCs. In this regard, it is important to stress that individual NCC can choose from the list of activities and deliverables included in this topic depending on their interest and mandate. There is no obligation for NCCs to execute all actions. This topic also considers providing support for the uptake of EU cybersecurity technologies and products, commercialisation and scale-up of the European cybersecurity start-up/SME ecosystem, in collaboration and complementarity with the European and ongoing national and regional initiatives, such as accelerator and incubation programmes and technology transfer programmes. Such a strategy should also include support for scale-ups, considering the use of public procurement and private investment. An essential aspect of this action is to create a framework for the emergence of such incubators and accelerators in the Member States, based on best practices and considering the specific needs and requirements arising from EU legislation (such as the Cyber Resilience Act, NIS 2 Directive). In addition, this topic could contribute to cybersecurity awareness. It is becoming increasingly important to inform and educate EU citizens on cybersecurity topics in their daily use of digital technologies. Cybersecurity awareness helps individuals and organisations to identify threats and take appropriate action. By promoting awareness, the likelihood of incidents and data breaches can be reduced. Within this topic, NCCs are encouraged to build upon ongoing initiatives, including for example the ones from the EC and ENISA, to improve the awareness of EU citizens, businesses and organisations about cybersecurity risks and threats and to support Europe-wide actions to increase the number of students in cybersecurity courses, students engaged in cybersecurity research activities and students and young professionals choosing a career in cybersecurity. Furthermore, European companies are innovative and develop highly competitive products, but the still underdeveloped Digital Single Market confines most of these companies (especially SMEs and start-ups) to their home country. A platform that can open the European market for small and medium-sized enterprises would also act as a springboard into international markets. This platform will ensure the competitiveness of European cybersecurity solutions. As such, this topic could also support the EU market’s growth in cybersecurity products and services by providing a platform on which European SMEs and start-ups can post their (market-ready) products and solutions and on which businesses, public authorities and private individuals can search for the best solution for their needs, regardless of the country. The National Coordination Centre should carry out, depending on their decision, one or more of the following tasks: Acting as contact points at the national level for the Cybersecurity Competence Community to support the ECCC in achieving its objectives and missions. Providing expertise and actively contributing to the strategic tasks of the ECCC, taking into account relevant national and regional challenges for cybersecurity in different sectors and deliver tasks supporting the implementation of the Cyber skills Academy. Promoting, encouraging and facilitating the participation of civil society and industry, in particular start-ups and SMEs, academic and research communities and other actors at Member State level in cross-border projects and cybersecurity actions funded through all relevant Union programmes. Providing technical assistance to stakeholders by supporting stakeholders in their application phase for projects managed by the ECCC, and in full compliance with the rules of sound financial management, especially on conflicts of interests. This should be done in close coordination with the relevant NCPs set up by the Member States. Seeking to establish synergies with relevant activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies. Where relevant, implementing specific actions for which grants have been awarded by the ECCC, including through the provision of financial support to third parties in accordance with Article 204 of the Financial Regulation under the conditions specified in the grant agreements concerned, in particular aimed at strengthening the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions (notably by SMEs). Supporting the scaling-up of start-ups by finding other funding to implement existing projects. Promoting and disseminating the relevant outcomes of the work of the Network and the ECCC at national, regional or local level. assessing requests for becoming part of the Cybersecurity Competence Community by entities established in the same Member State as the NCC. advocating and promoting involvement by relevant entities in the activities arising from the ECCC, the Network of National Coordination Centres, and the Cybersecurity Competence Community, and monitoring, as appropriate, the level of engagement with actions awarded for cybersecurity research, developments and deployments. Supporting the Cybersecurity Competence Community registration (on platforms such as ATLAS) and contributing to the development of suitable community management tools. read more Expected effects and impacts In addition, this action aims to promote safer digital behaviours, grow talents and attract more youth to cybersecurity careers; the NCCs could also, depending on their national context, carry out one or more of the following tasks: Provide support to innovative ideas towards market-readiness. Promote cybersecurity awareness, best practices, and careers in schools, universities, and community events (for instance by launching a pan-European programme where young individuals will be trained as ambassadors to promote cybersecurity.) Strengthen collaboration between institutions for higher education, e.g. by jointly organising events, by teaching students and working together on cutting-edge research. Support activities in primary and secondary levels of education to increase cybersecurity awareness and hygiene, through educating the teachers and educators. Build stronger partnerships with established SMEs, tech companies, and government agencies to develop and distribute software tools and services that assist in early threat detection, actor identification, and threat evolution monitoring. These collaborations can ensure that cybersecurity professionals have access to the latest tools and technologies for effective threat management. In collaboration with other entities, as needed, organise periodic cybersecurity boot camps, challenges, awareness campaigns and training courses across Europe, specifically for SMEs or students (e.g. focusing on equipping participants with hands on skills to manage prevalent cyber threats through training sessions, workshops, and simulation activities tailored to their industry). Organise periodic awareness raising campaigns, at national and regional level, to increase cybersecurity awareness and hygiene aimed at different demographics. Organise national and regional cyber exercises to enhance the security and resilience of critical sectors as well as SMEs. Foster a community of cybersecurity professionals who can share their experiences, challenges, and solutions. Support and encourage the uptake of cybersecurity educational policy goals in national (cybersecurity) strategies. Promote safer digital behaviours and more youth considering cybersecurity careers. The action could also aim to: Support the adoption of market-ready innovative cybersecurity solutions, including solutions developed in the framework of EU-supported research and innovation projects. Provide and deploy up to date tools and services to organisations (in particular SMEs) to prepare, protect (e.g. network security, advanced two-factor or passwordless authentication) and respond to cybersecurity threats. This topic targets exclusively National Coordination Centres which have been recognised by the Commission as having the capacity to manage funds to achieve the mission and objectives laid down in the Regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres. These actions aim at the operation of National Coordination Centres, which occupy a central role in the cybersecurity landscape as foreseen in Regulation (EU) 2021/887. Due to the synergetic role they play with regard to the activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies, they must be able to handle sensitive information, and be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt undue foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions are subject to Article 12(5) of the DEP Regulation (2021/694). read more Expected results Depending on the decision of each NCC, one or more of the following should be covered: Network of national initiatives to accelerate the cybersecurity industry and facilitate Access-to-Market. European frameworks for establishing cybersecurity incubators and accelerators. Cybersecurity Community Observatory to inform subsequent policy interventions by the ECCC and NCCs. Matchmaking events to create connections and build trust; platforms and events for Access-to-Finance and Access-to-Market including in the area of dual-use technologies Strengthened Cybersecurity Community to support the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre; Maintained technical registration possibilities for candidates for the Cybersecurity Competence Community; Technical assistance for potential applicants for ECCC calls.

    'short description The National Coordination Centres (NCCs) set up by the Regulation (EU) 2021/887 are designed to work together through a network and to contribute to achieving the objectives of the regulation and to foster the Cybersecurity Competence Community in each Member State, by contributing to the acquisition of the necessary capacity. National Coordination Centres can also support priority areas such as the implementation of EU legislation (Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the proposed Cyber Resilience Act and the Cybersecurity Act). Call objectives The objective of this topic is to support the operation of the NCCs and to enable them to support the cybersecurity community, including SMEs, for the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions and strengthen cybersecurity capacities. This could also be achieved by using Financial Support for Third Parties (FSTPs). Based on the financing received in previous years and on the different operational start dates in the Member States, this activity aims to continue providing support for NCCs. In this regard, it is important to stress that individual NCC can choose from the list of activities and deliverables included in this topic depending on their interest and mandate. There is no obligation for NCCs to execute all actions. This topic also considers providing support for the uptake of EU cybersecurity technologies and products, commercialisation and scale-up of the European cybersecurity start-up/SME ecosystem, in collaboration and complementarity with the European and ongoing national and regional initiatives, such as accelerator and incubation programmes and technology transfer programmes. Such a strategy should also include support for scale-ups, considering the use of public procurement and private investment. An essential aspect of this action is to create a framework for the emergence of such incubators and accelerators in the Member States, based on best practices and considering the specific needs and requirements arising from EU legislation (such as the Cyber Resilience Act, NIS 2 Directive). In addition, this topic could contribute to cybersecurity awareness. It is becoming increasingly important to inform and educate EU citizens on cybersecurity topics in their daily use of digital technologies. Cybersecurity awareness helps individuals and organisations to identify threats and take appropriate action. By promoting awareness, the likelihood of incidents and data breaches can be reduced. Within this topic, NCCs are encouraged to build upon ongoing initiatives, including for example the ones from the EC and ENISA, to improve the awareness of EU citizens, businesses and organisations about cybersecurity risks and threats and to support Europe-wide actions to increase the number of students in cybersecurity courses, students engaged in cybersecurity research activities and students and young professionals choosing a career in cybersecurity. Furthermore, European companies are innovative and develop highly competitive products, but the still underdeveloped Digital Single Market confines most of these companies (especially SMEs and start-ups) to their home country. A platform that can open the European market for small and medium-sized enterprises would also act as a springboard into international markets. This platform will ensure the competitiveness of European cybersecurity solutions. As such, this topic could also support the EU market’s growth in cybersecurity products and services by providing a platform on which European SMEs and start-ups can post their (market-ready) products and solutions and on which businesses, public authorities and private individuals can search for the best solution for their needs, regardless of the country. The National Coordination Centre should carry out, depending on their decision, one or more of the following tasks: Acting as contact points at the national level for the Cybersecurity Competence Community to support the ECCC in achieving its objectives and missions. Providing expertise and actively contributing to the strategic tasks of the ECCC, taking into account relevant national and regional challenges for cybersecurity in different sectors and deliver tasks supporting the implementation of the Cyber skills Academy. Promoting, encouraging and facilitating the participation of civil society and industry, in particular start-ups and SMEs, academic and research communities and other actors at Member State level in cross-border projects and cybersecurity actions funded through all relevant Union programmes. Providing technical assistance to stakeholders by supporting stakeholders in their application phase for projects managed by the ECCC, and in full compliance with the rules of sound financial management, especially on conflicts of interests. This should be done in close coordination with the relevant NCPs set up by the Member States. Seeking to establish synergies with relevant activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies. Where relevant, implementing specific actions for which grants have been awarded by the ECCC, including through the provision of financial support to third parties in accordance with Article 204 of the Financial Regulation under the conditions specified in the grant agreements concerned, in particular aimed at strengthening the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions (notably by SMEs). Supporting the scaling-up of start-ups by finding other funding to implement existing projects. Promoting and disseminating the relevant outcomes of the work of the Network and the ECCC at national, regional or local level. assessing requests for becoming part of the Cybersecurity Competence Community by entities established in the same Member State as the NCC. advocating and promoting involvement by relevant entities in the activities arising from the ECCC, the Network of National Coordination Centres, and the Cybersecurity Competence Community, and monitoring, as appropriate, the level of engagement with actions awarded for cybersecurity research, developments and deployments. Supporting the Cybersecurity Competence Community registration (on platforms such as ATLAS) and contributing to the development of suitable community management tools. read more Expected effects and impacts In addition, this action aims to promote safer digital behaviours, grow talents and attract more youth to cybersecurity careers; the NCCs could also, depending on their national context, carry out one or more of the following tasks: Provide support to innovative ideas towards market-readiness. Promote cybersecurity awareness, best practices, and careers in schools, universities, and community events (for instance by launching a pan-European programme where young individuals will be trained as ambassadors to promote cybersecurity.) Strengthen collaboration between institutions for higher education, e.g. by jointly organising events, by teaching students and working together on cutting-edge research. Support activities in primary and secondary levels of education to increase cybersecurity awareness and hygiene, through educating the teachers and educators. Build stronger partnerships with established SMEs, tech companies, and government agencies to develop and distribute software tools and services that assist in early threat detection, actor identification, and threat evolution monitoring. These collaborations can ensure that cybersecurity professionals have access to the latest tools and technologies for effective threat management. In collaboration with other entities, as needed, organise periodic cybersecurity boot camps, challenges, awareness campaigns and training courses across Europe, specifically for SMEs or students (e.g. focusing on equipping participants with hands on skills to manage prevalent cyber threats through training sessions, workshops, and simulation activities tailored to their industry). Organise periodic awareness raising campaigns, at national and regional level, to increase cybersecurity awareness and hygiene aimed at different demographics. Organise national and regional cyber exercises to enhance the security and resilience of critical sectors as well as SMEs. Foster a community of cybersecurity professionals who can share their experiences, challenges, and solutions. Support and encourage the uptake of cybersecurity educational policy goals in national (cybersecurity) strategies. Promote safer digital behaviours and more youth considering cybersecurity careers. The action could also aim to: Support the adoption of market-ready innovative cybersecurity solutions, including solutions developed in the framework of EU-supported research and innovation projects. Provide and deploy up to date tools and services to organisations (in particular SMEs) to prepare, protect (e.g. network security, advanced two-factor or passwordless authentication) and respond to cybersecurity threats. This topic targets exclusively National Coordination Centres which have been recognised by the Commission as having the capacity to manage funds to achieve the mission and objectives laid down in the Regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres. These actions aim at the operation of National Coordination Centres, which occupy a central role in the cybersecurity landscape as foreseen in Regulation (EU) 2021/887. Due to the synergetic role they play with regard to the activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies, they must be able to handle sensitive information, and be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt undue foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions are subject to Article 12(5) of the DEP Regulation (2021/694). read more Expected results Depending on the decision of each NCC, one or more of the following should be covered: Network of national initiatives to accelerate the cybersecurity industry and facilitate Access-to-Market. European frameworks for establishing cybersecurity incubators and accelerators. Cybersecurity Community Observatory to inform subsequent policy interventions by the ECCC and NCCs. Matchmaking events to create connections and build trust; platforms and events for Access-to-Finance and Access-to-Market including in the area of dual-use technologies Strengthened Cybersecurity Community to support the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre; Maintained technical registration possibilities for candidates for the Cybersecurity Competence Community; Technical assistance for potential applicants for ECCC calls.

    'short description This action aims to strengthen the cybersecurity of hospitals and healthcare providers. The goal is to ensure that hospitals and healthcare providers, which are crucial operators in the health sector, can effectively detect, monitor, and respond to cyber threats, particularly ransomware, which pose significant risks, thereby enhancing the resilience of the European healthcare system. The action will contribute to the EU action plan on cybersecurity in hospitals and healthcare, adopted by the Commission in January 2025. Call objectives This action addresses the growing need for continuous cybersecurity monitoring, threat intelligence, and incident response in hospitals and healthcare providers, which often lack dedicated cybersecurity resources to adequately protect themselves from cyber threats. The action will support pilot projects, which will bring together stakeholders such as regional and/or national clusters associations of hospitals and healthcare providers (such as national healthcare systems, hospitals or associations of hospitals, healthcare providers and/or professional associations of healthcare practitioners), as well as cybersecurity service providers. The pilot projects will define the state of preparedness of clusters of hospitals and healthcare providers in the European Union, to be able to assess their needs. Based on this analysis, they will prepare an overview of the state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions and resources needed (technologies, services, tools, human resources, training needs, etc.) for hospitals and healthcare providers to meet the scope of the action. These may include, for example: Security Operation Centres offering real-time monitoring, threat detection, and rapid incident response, and advanced cybersecurity tools, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, threat intelligence, and automated response capabilities, among others. The pilots will develop technical plans, tailored to the needs of representative hospitals and healthcare providers (e.g. small or large hospitals, private healthcare providers, etc.) which will also need to include best implementation recommendations and cost estimates for effective deployment. The pilot projects will conduct a demo implementation of these technical plans to demonstrate their effectiveness in operations at the stakeholders’ sites, showcasing different use cases for different user groups at small, medium and large hospitals and healthcare providers, at least in two different Member States. The pilot projects will serve as demonstration projects and will also provide cybersecurity education and training to the staff of their partner hospitals and healthcare providers, enhancing awareness and ensuring best practices in safeguarding sensitive healthcare information.

    'short description Protecting individuals'' personal data and ensuring privacy while allowing for data processing and analysis is fundamental for our society. Privacy-preserving techniques allow to minimize the amount of personal data collected and processed, and to protect that data through advanced cryptographic methods. Call objectives Machine-learning methodologies are leveraged to dissect medical and behavioural data, aiming to unearth causations and insights into cyber attacks or threats. However, a substantial portion of this data comprises personal information, (such as sensitive health data), raising concerns over potential breaches or misuse, thus jeopardizing the privacy of individuals, societal well-being, and economic stability. In addition, the challenges related to the exploitation of non-personal/industrial data assets, which could impede the full realization of the data-driven economy, are also subject to the work that can be proposed under this topic. Solutions that can provide security against quantum adversaries are also encouraged. Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as cryptographic anonymous credentials, differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, advanced digital signatures, such as ring signatures, blind signatures and attribute-based credentials hold promise in mitigating these challenges, yet their practical application necessitates further refinement and rigorous testing. Consortia are encouraged to propose solutions that can improve the usability and effectiveness of different PETs in realistic environment and to investigate their integration within common European data spaces.

    'short description Protecting individuals'' personal data and ensuring privacy while allowing for data processing and analysis is fundamental for our society. Privacy-preserving techniques allow to minimize the amount of personal data collected and processed, and to protect that data through advanced cryptographic methods. Call objectives Machine-learning methodologies are leveraged to dissect medical and behavioural data, aiming to unearth causations and insights into cyber attacks or threats. However, a substantial portion of this data comprises personal information, (such as sensitive health data), raising concerns over potential breaches or misuse, thus jeopardizing the privacy of individuals, societal well-being, and economic stability. In addition, the challenges related to the exploitation of non-personal/industrial data assets, which could impede the full realization of the data-driven economy, are also subject to the work that can be proposed under this topic. Solutions that can provide security against quantum adversaries are also encouraged. Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as cryptographic anonymous credentials, differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, advanced digital signatures, such as ring signatures, blind signatures and attribute-based credentials hold promise in mitigating these challenges, yet their practical application necessitates further refinement and rigorous testing. Consortia are encouraged to propose solutions that can improve the usability and effectiveness of different PETs in realistic environment and to investigate their integration within common European data spaces. The inclusion of agile schemes designed in a modular way to support the transition to post-quantum PETs and the design, improvement and security analysis of quantum-resistant PETs is welcome, in light of the advances of quantum technologies. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals should also focus on enhancing the usability, scalability, and dependability of secure and PETs within supply chains, while seamlessly integrating with existing infrastructures and conventional security protocols.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaSubject to restrictions for the protection of European communication networks.',

    'short description The aim of this call is to tackle the challenges of an effective integration of PQC algorithms in Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs), which offers efficient migration strategies and strong business continuity guarantees. The call targets the different actors involved in the PKI ecosystems and supply and value chains, who all have a unique set of diverse needs and interdependencies, such as Certificate Authorities (CAs), intermediate CAs, researchers, end-users in different domains, and vendors. Call objectives Proposals shall target activities on the following subjects: design of digital signature combiners and key encapsulation mechanism combiners. the testing of deployment of certificates in protocols that use those certificates. the development of novel protocols for Automatic Certificate Management and revocation and of novel protocols for (privacy-friendly) certificate-transparency. the development of methods and tools that can be used by experts across various PKI domains, including all aspects of key management of asymmetric systems. Proposals should carefully consider the requirements and constraints, such as security level, performance and business continuity, in a broad range of applications relevant for critical societal sectors and processes (such as governmental services, telecom, banking, smart homes, e-Health, automotive, and other sectors). Proposals should address functions such as key establishment, digital signatures, and secure communication protocols that require careful adaptation with post-quantum counterparts to ensure resilience against threats posed by quantum-capable adversaries. Proposals should safeguard compatibility with existing legacy systems. To achieve this, a transition to PKIs that support both pre-quantum and post-quantum cryptography should be addressed. The proposed systems should be able to seamlessly interact with legacy systems by disabling the post-quantum component as needed while preventing downgrade attacks. Relying solely on PQC solutions in this intermediate transition phase could introduce security risks given that the security analysis of the cryptosystems and of their implementations is not as mature as for their pre-quantum counterparts. Proposals should therefore use combinations of PQC solutions and established pre-quantum solutions, making sure to provide strongest-link security, meaning that the system remains secure as long as at least one of the components of the combination is secure. For certificates for protocols that support negotiation, such as X.509 certificates for the Transport Layer (TLS), the use of post-quantum key exchange has already been demonstrated and can be implemented in a decentralised manner. Many other protocols need to be migrated, and this process will be more complex when old and new configurations must coexist. Moreover, for applications in IoT, smartcards, identity documents and others, the migration strategies defined for the core use cases of X.509 may well not work. Proposals should develop clear procedures to effectively guide the various stakeholders involved in PKIs across different usage domains through the transition process. Effective consortia should comprise a diverse range of actors along the entire PKI chain, encompassing expertise in areas such as software development, hardware implementation, cryptographic research, standardisation, policy, and application deployment, as well as organisations that can provide user case studies and real-world applications. read more Expected effects and impacts Activities should include some or all of the following: Identification of requirements necessary to implement hybrid certificates. Development of approaches and techniques for constructing cryptographic combiners for different protocols. Testing of the combiners for issuance of new certificates for the different applications, taking into consideration the need to balance the growth of key, signature, and ciphertext sizes, which can lead to compatibility issues with standards, such as PKI certificates, revocation mechanisms, (privacy-friendly) certificate transparency mechanisms, the use of different cryptographic protocols across certificate chains, the applications requirements, such as security level, time-constraints in signing and verification steps, communication/computational and storage overhead, and hardware optimisation requirements. Development of and/or further improvement of open-source libraries. Development of novel protocols for Automatic Certificate Management and revocation, and of novel protocols for (privacy-friendly) certificate-transparency. Support to standardisation activities. Development of recipes for the design and deployment of the new PKIs, with analysis that depends on each component of a given PKI. • Tests on specialised uses of X.509 certificates other than the core cases using TLS, such as roots of trust, device integrity, firmware signing, and others. Design, improvement and testing of X.509 alternatives, such as, among others, Merkle tree ladders, the GNU Name System, older proposals such as SPKI and SDSI and the use of key encapsulation mechanisms for on-demand authentication in place of signatures. Awareness and training activities for stakeholders with different profiles, emphasising the interdependencies in the transition and facilitating a broader understanding of the technical standards amongst PKI users. Participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, this topic is subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694. read more Expected results New combiners ensuring that cryptographic schemes provide at least 128-bit security against quantum adversaries. Experimental evaluation on hybrid certificates in several standard protocols that use those certificates, also considering options for different cryptographic algorithms at the root Certification Authority level and at the other levels, in terms of security, performance, and backward compatibility. The impact of such certificates in protocols should be tested via open-source libraries. New and/or improved open-source libraries for certificate requests, issuance, validation, revocation and (privacy-friendly) certificate transparency. Clear procedures taking into account all aspects of key management: requirements for signature generation, in terms of the software and hardware used to create signatures as well as the secure storage and handling of private keys to maintain their authenticity and confidentiality, signature validation, with specification of the data required for verifying signatures and outlining the conditions necessary for a successful signature verification process, signature life-cycle process, and validity status of signatures.

    'short description EIT Urban Mobility invites innovators from across Europe to submit a proposal to its Strategic Innovation Open Call, designed to accelerate the deployment of impactful solutions that address the most pressing challenges in urban mobility. Call objectives The call focuses on supporting ambitious, market-critical projects that tackle clearly defined problems faced by cities, public authorities, and mobility providers. We aim to de-risk development and enable large-scale deployment by backing solutions with a clear path to market and the potential to scale across Europe. Through this call, EIT Urban Mobility fosters innovation and strengthens Europe’s competitiveness by encouraging collaboration across the EIT Knowledge Triangle—education, research, and business—alongside a fourth essential partner: cities. The Call will focus on five sectors in which we believe Europe has the potential to innovate and create impact: Urban logistics, Public transport, Mobility data management, Electrification of transport and alternative fuels, and Health and mobility. In the future, the Call may also include specific topic scopes to address key market opportunities or urgent market failures that can be addressed through our funding. read more Expected effects and impacts At EIT Urban Mobility we are looking for ambitious collaborative projects that accelerate the adoption of impactful innovation. To support this, we are refining our project frameworks to better accommodate initiatives with greater scale and vision. While we remain flexible in what we fund, a clear focus on commercialisation is a key pre-requisite — projects must demonstrate strong market potential and a credible path to market by the end of implementation. The solution/s should be designed for sale to external clients and replicable beyond the initial use case. Projects with an internal focus — such as those optimising own operations or lacking a clearly marketable product or service — will be considered out of scope. To this end, EIT Urban Mobility is seeking projects that respond to one of the following frameworks: Solution package projects: Projects developing and testing multiple solutions addressing a shared urban mobility challenge across one or multiple demonstration sites. The focus is on creating a cohort of scalable solutions for commercialisation rather than investing in a single, complex solution. Value chain projects: These projects unite key players across the value chain, ensuring all essential roles are integrated to make an innovation viable. Solutions (products, services, new business models or operational approaches) should address well-identified critical inefficiencies in industrial value chains or public-sector-driven challenges. Single solution projects: Projects supporting high-impact solutions that require longer times and budget for extended development, validation, and regulatory approvals to reach full market readiness. To ensure strategic fit, all projects must demonstrate market criticality and propose a convincing path to market. We seek initiatives that address clearly defined urban mobility challenges aligned with policy priorities and pressing market or customer needs. At the same time, projects must go beyond prototyping and testing to cover essential steps such as certification, scalability, intellectual property protection, and preparation for commercialisation within the project timeframe. read more Expected results The Call will focus on five sectors in which we believe Europe has the potential to innovate and create impact: Urban logistics Solutions (products, services and business models) that reduce the negative externalities of urban logistics – such as congestion, emissions and noise – while enhancing efficiency, resilience, sustainability and integration with the urban environment, especially in last-mile operations. Innovative concepts for logistics hubs and digitally enabled solutions that foster greater collaboration among logistics operators, cities and users are particularly encouraged. Public transport Solutions that strengthen public transport as the backbone of a resilient, sustainable, inclusive and multimodal mobility ecosystem, by improving its attractiveness and competitiveness – with the clear goal of attracting users away from private cars. New concepts, technologies and business models that enhance demand-responsive transport and integrate shared mobility services with public transit –aimed at improving first- and last-mile connectivity and expanding overall network coverage are encouraged. Mobility data management Data-driven solutions that enhance the performance, efficiency and responsiveness of urban mobility systems through e.g. the use of advanced analytics, AI, quantum technology or real time data – in alignment with EU-level interoperability and data governance efforts (e.g. common data spaces, European data standards, open digital infrastructures). Solutions that enable cities and public authorities to make data-informed decisions – particularly for the design and implementation of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs), inclusive/participatory planning and citizen engagement, resilience and disruption response, or regulatory monitoring and enforcement (e.g. Low Emission Zones) – are particularly encouraged. All solutions should adhere to principles of data privacy, interoperability, replicability and scalability, while demonstrating a clear pathway to sustainable deployment and uptake. Electrification of transport and alternative fuels Solutions that advance zero-emission urban mobility through innovation across the electrification value chain, vehicles, new battery technologies, smart /dynamic charging infrastructure, grid integration or life battery extension, reuse and recycle. Alternative fuels solutions such as hydrogen applications, that support early adoption, reducing initial or operative costs, offer integrated solutions to the urban environment, and are viable to scale-up. Health and mobility Solutions that promote active mobility as a foundation for healthier urban lifestyles, by improving safety, convenience, inclusivity and integration within the urban environment, facilitating a modal shift towards active modes. Proposals should go beyond typical behavioural change campaigns, to include innovative and market-oriented solutions that strengthen the European cycling industry and align with the goals of the European Declaration on Cycling. Digital or public space design innovations must demonstrate a disruptive approach and clear potential for adoption by public authorities. This topic also includes innovations that monitor, reduce, or mitigate the health impacts of air and noise pollution in urban mobility systems – including solutions for cleaner transport, reduced exposure, and health-informed planning. read more',

    'short description This priority supports holistic and intersectional responses to discrimination and intolerance - in particular on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, colour and religion - as well as to racism and xenophobia, antigypsyism intolerance, including their manifestations on the ground. Such responses should aim to build trust between individuals, communities and national authorities. Call objectives The priority will support projects that help to effectively implement: the EU Anti-racism action plan, which aims to combat structural forms of racism faced in particular by people of colour and people of African descent, Muslims or people perceived as such, Roma as well as people of Asian descent. the Racial Equality Directive (Council Directive 2000/43/EC), which aims to lay down a framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment. the EU Roma strategic framework, which aims to promote effective equality, socio-economic inclusion and meaningful participation of Roma, and the Council Recommendation on Roma equality, inclusion and participation, which aims to have Member States adopt national Roma strategic frameworks; adopt and implement measures to promote equality and effectively prevent and combat discrimination, antigypsyism, social and economic exclusion, the extremely high at-risk-of-poverty rate and material and social deprivation among the Roma population; and step up meaningful participation by and consultation of Roma people. We are looking for projects that focus on: multisectoral cooperation between civil society organisations, public and private organisations and local authorities to address systemic and structural racism in areas related to access to quality housing, employment (i.a. skills, vocational training.) and social inclusion (fight against poverty, etc.). the reporting, rights-awareness, protection, advocacy and interest representation of victims. the diversity of Roma, with a specific focus on the political participation of Roma youth, the health of Roma women, the early childhood development and care of Roma children and environmental justice.

Activities that support specific political parties will not be funded, regardless of their grounds for applying or objectives. All activities should, both at design and implementation stage, incorporate a gender equality perspective. Thus, applicants are expected to conduct and include in their proposal a gender analysis (including non-binary people where applicable), which maps the potential different impact of the project and its activities on people in all their diversity. Applicants should demonstrate that they reflected on the equality dimension of their proposal and address it in a way that is proportionate to their project. Thereby, unintended negative effects of the intervention on any gender should be avoided (dono-harm approach). Applicants are encouraged to consult the key questions listed on the website of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) when conducting their gender analysis.

    'short description This priority aims at supporting civil society organisations to prevent and combat all forms and manifestations of antisemitism, offline and online, in line with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, and at supporting civil society organisations to foster Jewish life. Call objectives European Jews have been contributing to the social, political, economic and cultural development of Europe and are an inextricable part of Europe’s identity. Following the 7 October terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israeli society and the war that ensued, antisemitism has risen across Europe and around the world. This escalation has created a climate of everyday “ambient antisemitism”, characterised by growing insecurity, isolation and the erosion of trust within Jewish communities. Today, we are witnessing a troubling rise in Holocaust distortion and the worrying conflation of the Shoah with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. This distortion has a corrosive impact on the resilience of our society and democracy. Antisemitism and polarization pose a threat not only to the Jewish communities but also to the broader European society and undermine democratic values Priority 2 is split into an open sub-priority and a restricted sub-priority in support of public authorities. Sub-priority 2.1 – open call: This open sub-priority will support projects that help to implement the EU Strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life (2021-2030). We are looking for projects that focus on: raising awareness on contemporary antisemitism and its impact on society in general, and on specific target groups such as multipliers (educators, journalists, policy makers) and raising awareness about Jewish life to counter antisemitism; improving the monitoring of antisemitic incidents, encouraging reporting and strengthening cooperation with the police at local level; strengthening leadership capacities within Jewish communities to counter antisemitism, especially by developing professional networks, thus contributing to fostering Jewish life; building bridges between Jewish and other minority groups in the common fight against intolerance and discrimination. This sub-priority does not support research projects. Projects can be either national or transnational. Transnational projects are particularly encouraged. We particularly encourage projects to have at least one Jewish civil society organisation, or an organisation specialised in fighting antisemitism, as one of the main partners. Projects led by Jewish civil society organisations are also strongly encouraged.

Applicants should demonstrate that they reflected on the equality dimension of their proposal and address it in a way that is proportionate to their project. Thereby, unintended negative effects of the intervention on any gender should be avoided (dono-harm approach). Applicants are encouraged to consult the key questions listed on the website of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) when conducting their gender analysis. A gender-sensitive approach should include identification of best practices, data collection, including disaggregated statistics, information dissemination and monitoring and evaluation approaches. All activities must avoid discrimination, victimisation and stereotyping. All applicants who need further guidance are advised to consult the EIGE’s materials on gender analysis and DG JUST’s online workshop on gender mainstreaming projects. Where applicable, applicants are advised to complement their gender analysis with an analysis of other grounds of discrimination that can have an impact on project implementation.

    'short description This priority aims at supporting civil society organisations to prevent and combat all forms and manifestations of antisemitism, offline and online, in line with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, and at supporting civil society organisations to foster Jewish life. Call objectives European Jews have been contributing to the social, political, economic and cultural development of Europe and are an inextricable part of Europe’s identity. Following the 7 October terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israeli society and the war that ensued, antisemitism has risen across Europe and around the world. This escalation has created a climate of everyday “ambient antisemitism”, characterised by growing insecurity, isolation and the erosion of trust within Jewish communities. Today, we are witnessing a troubling rise in Holocaust distortion and the worrying conflation of the Shoah with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. This distortion has a corrosive impact on the resilience of our society and democracy. Antisemitism and polarization pose a threat not only to the Jewish communities but also to the broader European society and undermine democratic values Priority 2 is split into an open sub-priority and a restricted sub-priority in support of public authorities. Sub-priority 2.1 – open call: This open sub-priority will support projects that help to implement the EU Strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life (2021-2030). We are looking for projects that focus on: raising awareness on contemporary antisemitism and its impact on society in general, and on specific target groups such as multipliers (educators, journalists, policy makers) and raising awareness about Jewish life to counter antisemitism; improving the monitoring of antisemitic incidents, encouraging reporting and strengthening cooperation with the police at local level; strengthening leadership capacities within Jewish communities to counter antisemitism, especially by developing professional networks, thus contributing to fostering Jewish life; building bridges between Jewish and other minority groups in the common fight against intolerance and discrimination. This sub-priority does not support research projects. Projects can be either national or transnational. Transnational projects are particularly encouraged. We particularly encourage projects to have at least one Jewish civil society organisation, or an organisation specialised in fighting antisemitism, as one of the main partners. Projects led by Jewish civil society organisations are also strongly encouraged. Projects that promote partnerships based on the diversity of and tolerance among different groups and communities are also encouraged. Sub-priority 2.2 – restricted call in support of public authorities: This sub-priority aims at supporting public authorities to develop and implement their action plans on combating antisemitism. We are looking for projects that focus on: developing and/or implementing national action plans or strategies on combating antisemitism; improving the recording and reporting of antisemitic incidents and harmonising data collection in line with the Vienna Declaration; preventing and countering antisemitism, thus fostering Jewish life.

Projects concerning one ground of discrimination are not the focus of this priority. Call objectives We are looking for projects that focus on: strengthening the Diversity Charters network, supporting the implementation and further development of existing Diversity Charters in the EU and increasing the number of their signatories. The priority does not support research projects or projects on skills development. Projects can be either national or transnational. Transnational projects are particularly encouraged. Applications from consortia bringing together different types of organisations are particularly encouraged. Expected effects and impacts Increased number of organisations affiliated to a Diversity Charter; Increased knowledge and awareness on the benefits of diversity and inclusion at the workplace; Increased diversity at the workplace, supported by stronger links between the academic and research community and the business world; More inclusive workplaces and societies; Increased and improved Europe-wide guidance and tools to build inclusive workplaces and to measure diversity and inclusion at the workplace.

    'short description This priority supports key policy objectives set out in the LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020-2025 and will support projects that help to effectively implement it. The strategy includes initiatives to address intersectional discrimination and inequality experienced on grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics in employment, education, health and other areas of life. Call objectives We are looking for projects that focus on one or more of the following: addressing the challenges LGBTIQ people face in areas where they are particularly disadvantaged (e.g. education, health care, housing); LGBTIQ people in the most vulnerable situations, such as transgender and intersex people and those experiencing intersectional discrimination; and rainbow families. Projects should take into account the: Report on the Implementation of the LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020-2025 The 3rd LGBTIQ survey of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights 2023 special Eurobarometer on discrimination in the EU The priority does not support research projects. Projects can be either national or transnational. Transnational projects are particularly encouraged. We particularly encourage projects to have at least one LGBTIQ specific civil society organisation as one of the main partners. Projects led by LGBTIQ organisations are also encouraged. read more Expected effects and impacts Improved knowledge and awareness of the intersectional discrimination and inequality experienced by LGBTIQ people, in particular by transgender and intersex people, in employment, education and health, as well as solutions on how to tackle this; Increased awareness and improvement of skills of relevant professionals, including in the health sector and educational sector, media and business professionals, to counter stereotyping, stigmatisation, pathologisation, discrimination, harassment and bullying affecting LGBTIQ people; Increased support for LGBTIQ people and their families, including through information campaigns, support groups, counselling and other means, and improved knowledge and awareness of the challenges they face; Better guidance for national authorities and education providers on how to i. prevent and combat school violence and bullying against LGBTIQ students, ii. include positive representations of LGBTIQ diversity in education, iii. tackle gender and sexuality stereotypes in education and iv. accommodate the needs of transgender, intersex and non-binary children in educational settings. Improved data collection methods to better understand the needs and experiences of LGBTIQ people, informing evidence-based policies and interventions. read more Expected results Activities that can be funded: Coalition building, capacity building and training for professionals and victims of (intersectional) discrimination; Mutual learning, exchange of good practices, cooperation, including identifying best practices which may be transferable to other participating countries; Dissemination of information and awareness-raising, including via social media, press campaigns and through engaging with media industry; Data recording, data collection, surveys, monitoring and reporting of incidents of discrimination; Gender- and age-sensitive victim empowerment and support; Contributing to designing and implementing strategies or action plans. Priority will be given to practical projects that develop and implement specific measures and involve the target group. All consortia are encouraged to produce English translations of the main project’s outputs to increase the possibility of best practice exchange and dissemination of the results across the EU. Activities that support specific political parties will not be funded, regardless of their grounds for applying or objectives. All activities should, both at design and implementation stage, incorporate a gender equality perspective. Thus, applicants are expected to conduct and include in their proposal a gender analysis (including non-binary people where applicable), which maps the potential different impact of the project and its activities on people in all their diversity. Applicants should demonstrate that they reflected on the equality dimension of their proposal and address it in a way that is proportionate to their project. Thereby, unintended negative effects of the intervention on any gender should be avoided (dono-harm approach). Applicants are encouraged to consult the key questions listed on the website of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) when conducting their gender analysis. A gender-sensitive approach should include identification of best practices, data collection, including disaggregated statistics, information dissemination and monitoring and evaluation approaches. All activities must avoid discrimination, victimisation and stereotyping. All applicants who need further guidance are advised to consult the EIGE’s materials on gender analysis and DG JUST’s online workshop on gender mainstreaming projects. Where applicable, applicants are advised to complement their gender analysis with an analysis of other grounds of discrimination that can have an impact on project implementation. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate a good understanding of intersectional discrimination when framing target group needs and reflect this in their proposal. Reflections should be proportionate to the project’s scope and context. read more',

    'short description Operational Digital Platforms aim to support EU environmental and energy targets, improve the competitiveness of the EU industry and address the ongoing energy crisis, by providing both technologies and connectivity to enable a cyber-secure Internet of Energy and an optimised transport system along the major European paths. They are dedicated to “retro-fitting” the existing energy and/or transpor tinfrastructures with the required cross-border digital infrastructure. Call objectives ODPs will optimise energy use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and reduce the environmental impact, while increasing the benefits enabled by ICT. ODPs will build on and integrate with existing and emerging European data, cloud and edge computing and connectivity infrastructures, in particular those supported in other parts of the CEF Digital programme, the Digital Europe Programme, and the Horizon Europe programme. The ODPs will contribute to the achievement of EU technological sovereignty and to the security and resilience of energy supply and transports in the EU. This support contributes to the Digital Decade goals such as the deployment of 10,000 climate neutral highly secure edge nodes, etc. The projects supported by this call are expected to deploy cross-border digital infrastructure implementing an AI-Driven Operational Digital Platform (ODP) for Electricity Consumers and Integration of electric vehicles (EV), electric trucks (ET), renewable energy sources (RES) into the Grid. Firstly (based on Use case 1 from BEGONIA - ELECTRICITY CUSTOMER CENTRIC ODP), the platform would leverage AI, internet of things and advanced edge computing to bring to the centre of the grid the energy consumers, who are increasingly equipped with digital tools, such as smart meters, app monitoring their rooftop solar panels, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. It would enable them not just to consume, but to contribute to balance supply and demand, trade their flexibility or surplus power, and make informed decisions based on real-time data and AI-driven recommendations. The platform would create a digital space where households, businesses, aggregators, and energy suppliers interact transparently and in real-time. It would build on existing smart infrastructure, integrates with local energy markets, and respects national and EU regulatory frameworks. It would contribute to consumer empowerment in the energy system while delivering tangible benefits like cost savings, increased renewable usage, and improved grid stability. The platform would be designed to place consumers at the centre of the energy ecosystem by enabling smarter energy management, market participation, and seamless integration with RES. Its deployment is also expected to support grid operators by activating distributed flexibility, thereby reducing peak loads and improving system reliability. Secondly (based on Use case 2 from BEGONIA - AI-DRIVEN ODP FOR INTEGRATION OF EVS, ETS, RES AND GRID), the AI-driven platform aims to synchronise EV and ET charging with real-time electricity generation, grid capacity, and traffic conditions. It would allow fleet operators to plan charging around both logistics needs and energy constraints, while grid operators could anticipate demand and activate local flexibility, if needed. Additionally, the platform would provide a shared digital layer where energy and mobility actors could interact predictively and securely, for their mutual benefit. The deployment is expected to enable clean transport along key European corridors. It will link public and private charging stations, logistics hubs, and energy market actors, while supporting services that optimise cost, reduce losses, and enhance energy system reliability. The platform must include the maximum number of the following key functionalities: Real-time monitoring and feedback for consumers on energy rate use, carbon footprint, and tariff optimisation; AI-based advisory services, helping users to adjust their behaviours or schedules to match renewable availability. Participation in virtual energy communities (VECs), allowing local prosumers to trade surplus energy or flexibility; Integration of controllable assets such as EV chargers, heat pumps, or batteries to provide demand response; AI-powered charging optimisation, based on traffic, weather, grid conditions, and fleet schedules; Dynamic pricing and congestion signals, ensuring grid-aware energy consumption and EV charging; Smart routing tools for logistics managers, integrating vehicle range, charging station status, and energy prices; Integration of renewable generation (e.g. solar, wind) into vehicle charging plans Support for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations, where EVs can return energy to the grid during peak demand. Optional functionalities may include: Participation of data centres in flexibility markets, via dynamic load shifting or reserve services; Data centres workload migration tools, allowing computing tasks to be routed across borders to greener data centres. The evaluation of proposals shall prioritise those offering the higher number of functionalities, as they will be considered as having a higher impact. Such impact will be taken into account when evaluating the proposals under the “Impact” award criterion. The platform should follow a layered digital architecture, for example: Perception Layer which connects devices and assets that generate, consume, or store electricity and integrates data from vehicle systems, grid sensors, and weather/traffic APIs; Middleware Layer which manages secure and interoperable data exchange across jurisdictions and national and operator-specific systems as well as connects energy markets, building systems, and cloud orchestration software; Service Layer that delivers analytics, automation, and local market functionality; offers intelligent charging coordination, predictive energy demand, and fleet management tools; manages optimisation logic, flexibility bids, and load migration; Business Layer that supports consumer engagement, regulatory reporting, and value distribution. includes user interfaces for charging point operators (CPO), distribution system operators (DSO), logistics companies, and public authorities. delivers dashboards, sustainability reporting, and regulatory compliance tools. The proposed ODP should push the boundaries of energy operations by providing private and industrial players with robust digital tools for cross-border trading, monitoring and ownership management. It should be designed to manage European transport in increasingly automated and sustainable way bringing digitalisation and electrification of the sector to a new level. Its strong focus on AI-driven charging and route planning will provide a transport domain benchmarking. By creating transparency and real-time coordination across sectors, the platform is expected to enable more efficient use of both energy and transport infrastructure. The proposed ODP is not only expected to improve the sustainability of a high-impact sector due to increase energy demand because of the new AI tools, but also to open new opportunities for data centre operators to participate in energy markets and contribute to local energy resilience. The ODP should follow the BEGONIA project’s guidelines related to the architecture, governance and implementation of ODPs, and other preparation materials for delivering the functionalities. The platform should also ensure GDPR-compliant data governance and align with the Electricity Market Directive, the Data Act, and the AI Act. Please consult the call document for more information on the scope, including digital security requirements. read more Expected effects and impacts The project is expected to deploy cross-border digital infrastructure that will accelerate the digitalisation of the energy/mobility sector by enhancing interoperability and standardisation and trigger a public-private partnership virtuous circle of investment. To the extent possible, this infrastructure will build on and integrate with existing and emerging European data, cloud and edge computing and connectivity infrastructures. The project should lead to a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) and improvement in the energy and environmental performance of the European energy, transport and digital infrastructures thus addressing and easing the current energy and climate crisis and avoiding blackouts. The key performance indicators for the topic will include the number of connected operators supporting cross-border exchange of data and services, the number of interconnected cross border energy and/or transport systems, the amount of energy saved and the percentage of GHG emission decrease due to cross-border energy and/or transport exchange, as well as the degree of integration with the European data, computing, and connectivity infrastructure both for leveraging digital infrastructure and optimising its energy and environmental performance. read more Expected results Projects funded under this call should include specific deliverables, milestones and KPIs related to: Deploying fully functional, cross-border ODPs in line with the description in the scope section; Delivering quantifiable results in terms of CO₂ reduction, energy savings, and grid flexibility; Providing open, standards-based architectures suitable for replication in other Member States, also in line with the vision for an AI-enabled digital spine of the energy and e-mobility system and other EU initiatives; Strengthening collaboration across sectors (energy, transport, ICT) and across borders; Creating new business models for distributed energy resources, smart mobility, and sustainable infrastructure; Improving consumer empowerment, data transparency, and system efficiency.',

    'short description The overall objective is to ensure the full transposition of the acquis communautaire and its progressive implementation by well-structured and trained administration aiming to secure a high level of public health, animal health, animal welfare and plant health at the national and EU level. Call objectives The specific objective of this call is to support negotiation process, further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy within relevant competent authorities of the Republic of Serbia for Chapter 12: Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, Ministry of Health etc.). In 2013, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and the Republic of Serbia entered into force. Article 1, Section2 (d) of the SAA states that the aim of the Association established is "to support the efforts of Serbia to develop its economic and international cooperation, including through the approximation of its legislation to that of the Community". Working with MS partner/s will assist the Republic of Serbia in further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy and in enhancing economic integration with the European Union’s single market. The international project experts will assist the administrative structures in the Republic of Serbia in charge of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy in meeting opening and closing benchmarks and in meeting conditions within Chapter 12. Furthermore, Title VI-Approximation of law, law enforcement and competition rules, Article 72, Section 1 of the SAA states "the Parties recognize the importance of the approximation of the existing legislation in Serbia to that of the Community and of its effective implementation. Serbia shall endeavour to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation will be gradually made compatible with the Community acquis. Serbia shall ensure that existing and future legislation will be properly implemented and enforced". With respect to aforementioned, one of the mandatory results of the project will be implementation of Law on Official Controls supported through trainings, legislation guidelines, etc. intended for inspection services (Agricultural, Veterinary and 5 Phytosanitary Inspection (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management) and Sanitary Inspection (Ministry of Health)). The national Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development 2014-2024 was adopted by the Government of the Republic of Serbia in 2014 and in Section 3.3.3. Activities on the implementation of strategic objectives, this document reports "the first steps towards establishing and improving existing institutions, organizations and other entities have been taken. A large number of laws and regulations have been adopted, but their effective implementation is still in most areas, at early stages. Further harmonization will be based on EU legislation (acquis communautaire), along with the continued training of administration, entrepreneurs, farmers and all other stakeholders in the implementation of this very demanding legislation". For instance, the implementation of the Animal Health Law will be accomplished through trainings, legislation, guidelines, etc. envisaged within the project and intended for inspection services, veterinary service and laboratories. The same document states improving the quality and safety of products as one of the priority areas (page 76). It says "Improving the system and capacity in the area of food safety and quality entails creating an environment in which all relevant stakeholders in the production chain (public authorities and organisations, food industry, academia and consumers) adhere to the standards of the Codex alimentarius, taking responsibility and ensuring the safety and quality of food." The Progress Report 2024 (Commission Staff Working Document) from October 2024, under Section 5. Ability to assume the obligations of membership, Cluster 5: Resources, Agriculture and Cohesion, Chapter 12: Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy states that: Serbia is moderately prepared in the area of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy. No progress was made during the reporting period. The Commission’s recommendations from last year were not implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular: adopt framework legislation on food safety, official controls, animal welfare and genetically modified organisms, aligned with the EU acquis; strengthen administrative capacity to ensure correct implementation; adopt and start implementation of the national plan to align legislation with EU quality standards for raw milk; prioritise the process of upgrading food establishments to be in line with the EU acquis. The above listed documents apparently show that there is a necessity for further alignment with EU acquis in food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy, as well as a need for further adjustment of relevant institutional capacities necessary to reduce resulting gaps and fulfil needs and obligations originating from these documents and from negotiation process. read more Expected results Component 1: Strategic and legislative framework of the Republic of Serbia supported in meeting conditions within Chapter 12: Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy Result 1.1.

    'short description The awarded consortium will be responsible for designing, developing, and implementing an app for truckers, free of charge, where drivers and operators can access detailed information about any point of interest, and provide their feedback. The information generated by the app should also be made available and exploitable by third party systems. The work includes the identification of points of interest in scope, defining main indicators and information needs of truckers, determine functional requirements, development of the app and the supporting systems, testing, deployment and communication. Call objectives 1. Improve Working Conditions for Truck Drivers The app will empower drivers by giving them the means to rate and review rest areas, service stations, and facilities. This feedback loop will help other users identify gaps in quality and accessibility, pushing providers to upgrade their standards improving daily working conditions on the road. 2. Address the Shortage of Drivers By highlighting high-quality, driver-friendly infrastructure and working environments, the app contributes to making the profession more attractive. Transparent information and peer reviews help new and existing drivers be informed and take quality choices, making them more likely to stay or join the industry. 3. Safe and Secure Parking The app will map, and rate parking areas based on security, cleanliness, availability, and amenities. This enables drivers to plan rest stops more confidently and safely. It will also give visibility to decision makers and businesses on where are the main gaps and underserve areas across the whole EU road infrastructure. read more Expected effects and impacts Building a reliable and user-friendly platform to access information and provide feedback on truckers points of interest, will reduce the existing information asymmetries in the market. Truckers will have advance access to reliable, community-driven information about services at points of interest along their route, including ratings and comments on service quality. This information, based on feedback from previous drivers, will guide decisions made by truckers and transport managers at various stages of their operations—whether negotiating contracts, planning routes, or performing a transport operation. By relying on the experiences of others, they will prioritize stops and rest areas that have the highest approval ratings from the wider community. The reputational value of points of interest will drive demand towards the highest-rated locations, while reducing truck stops at those with the lowest ratings. Administrators of these points of interest will have a clear incentive to invest in better infrastructure and service quality to improve their reputation, thereby increasing consumer demand and positively impacting overall business performance. The app will create a virtuous cycle that shifts the market dynamics towards a focus on service quality, significantly improving the working conditions of truck drivers by harnessing their consumer power. Additionally, the app will shed light on undignified situations and poor conditions in which truck drivers are often treated, raising awareness and driving positive change. The app will empower truck drivers by allowing them to share their opinions, report bad practices, and make informed decisions. The app will make each community member, an agent in the push for dignify working conditions within their profession. By fostering a sense of solidarity and accountability, the app will not only improve individual experiences but also drive systemic change. The long-term consequences of this project if it succeed will be far-reaching. It can contribute to a more attractive profession for truckers and increased respect for the vital role they play in the economy. The project will help alleviate the current shortage of drivers, often attributed to poor working conditions and low job satisfaction. As a result, the trucking industry will benefit from improved productivity, reduced turnover rates, and a more skilled and motivated workforce, ultimately leading to a more competitive and resilient transportation network. read more Expected results Activities to be supported under this action shall consist of technical and organisational activities to facilitate the development and deployment of the truckers’ points of interest information and rating app and interoperability services, also known as “Empowering Truckers” app. Activity 1 – Market research, user requirements identification and scoping. Conduct market research: Understanding the nature of the transport and logistic sector and the problem that is intended to be tackled (poor facilities and road infrastructure and quality of services for professional truck drivers). Identifying the landscape of key stakeholders, including professional truck drivers, fleet managers, transport companies and service providers at points of interest (e.g., rest areas, fueling stations, loading and unloading sites). Assessing similar solutions in the market centered around consumer-feedback, evaluating their key features, business model and their overall strengths and gaps. Evaluating other platforms and IT services used by truck drivers to plan, manage or get informed about services on the road (booking parking spots, trip planning, ...) or to conduct their business such as Transport Management Systems or Freight Exchange Platforms. Exploring the landscape of potential partnerships with service providers, industry associations and technology developers that could facilitate and drive the adoption of the app. Conduct focus groups or any other form of stakeholder engagement activities targeting specially the main users of the tool (truck drivers), as well as other users of the tool such as transport managers or points of interest administrators to identify the key user requirements and information needs. Define the business goals, scope, use cases, user requirements and rating metrics of the solution using the results of the market research and stakeholders'' engagement activities. Define the key metrics for the evaluation of the project. Activity 2 – App design and conceptualisation Define the app''s functional requirements: Define the app''s primary features and capabilities, identifying the app’s core functionalities. Outline user journeys and describe user cases. Determine technical requirements and architecture in accordance with performance and security needs: app speed, reliability, offline capabilities and scalability, data governance and user authentication and authorization policies. Create wireframes and first prototypes of the app, laying out the structure and flow of the app, sketching the app’s user interface, defining the structure of each screen and the key interactive elements. Test and validate first concepts iterating and refining the initial design, based on stakeholder''s feedback. In view of the second pre-financing payment up to 20% of the total price, a progress report is required covering the work completed under Activity 1 and 2. Activity 3 – App development Design the visual elements and user experience (UI/UX) of the app, focusing on usability, accessibility, and aesthetics creating an intuitive and engaging interface for users. Develop the front-end of the app, focusing on the design, functionality, and interaction. Develop the back-end server infrastructure, databases, and functions that will support the app’s functionality and store user data. Develop the web service or API that will enable third-party applications to access and utilize the data within the app, providing a seamless way to integrate app information into external systems. Allow external developers to fetch data such as user reviews, service ratings, and location details, enriching their own applications and expanding the app''s ecosystem. Activity 4 – App testing and piloting Test the app thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. This stage includes functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) as well as the integration with third parties. Pilot the app by releasing it to a small group of external users for real-world testing and feedback. Introduce the necessary adjustments to the app, with the insights and lessons obtained during the beta phase. In view of the third pre-financing payment up to 20% of the total price, a progress report is required covering the work completed under Activity 3 and 4. Activity 5 – Launch and promotion Deploy the app in app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store) for public download. Implement and execute a marketing and adoption strategy. Monitor the app performance and provide maintenance and support. Evaluate the project performance using the metrics defined in Activity 1. Activity 6 – Governance and strategy a.

    'short description The scope covers quasi-solid and all-solid-state lithium-ion battery technologies (up to 5% liquid electrolyte weight percentage) which encompasses Si-C composite anodes or lithium metal anodes. Call objectives Process-Specific Machinery and Technological Upgrades Projects are expected to identify and target at least one key manufacturing process for enhancement, and to focus on optimising and testing the specific critical process(es) within existing production lines rather than overhauling the entire production system. These processes must be critical to the transition from liquid electrolyte to solid-state batteries and have the potential for high-impact improvements in terms of production yield, quality, cost, and sustainability including energy consumption. Projects are expected to cover all of the following tasks: Provide detailed plans on how existing machinery and systems can be adapted to optimise the chosen process, ensuring that these enhancements are both impactful and economically viable; Modify existing machinery to better support the specialised requirements of the targeted process. This includes enhancing capabilities to handle new materials and designs efficiently; Develop and implement technological innovations that specifically enhance the chosen process, such as precision manufacturing tools and additive manufacturing. Feasibility and Impact Validation Projects are expected to conduct pilot testing to validate the feasibility and benefits of the enhancements on the chosen process. Proposals are expected to include clear metrics for evaluating improvements, such as reductions in energy consumption, increases in production yield, and enhancements in product consistency. Projects are encouraged to evaluate the impact of the new or improved process on other steps in the manufacturing line, including any necessary modifications to adjacent processes, or across other parts of the production line and in different manufacturing environments. Advanced Materials and Cell Design Integration Projects are expected to tailor the design of the produced cell to maximise the benefits of the improved process. This can be done through the development of new advanced materials or through the integration of existing materials to improve the targeted manufacturing process. Digitalisation, Data Integration and Analytics and Process Control Projects are expected to cover at least one of the following tasks: Implement advanced control systems and digital technologies that are specifically designed to optimise the chosen process, improving efficiency, and reducing waste; Develop new process simulation methods, process models and materials chemistry models allowing to virtually assess novel cell designs’ flexible manufacturability at scale for adapted existing plants. In addition, projects are encouraged to leverage data analytics and data-driven approaches (artificial intelligence) to enhance decision-making and process optimisation, focusing on the specific needs and challenges of the targeted process. Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan). Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission''s Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of performing experimental research on battery performance and/or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu). JRC shall assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal). read more Expected effects and impacts Projects are expected to collaborate and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-D2-02-06. To strengthen the European battery ecosystem, projects are expected to use materials, products and equipment produced in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe, unless it is demonstrated that no valid option exists. The procurement strategies should be described in the proposal, especially and to the furthest extent possible the place of production of the elements.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'short description The deployment of CCAM systems in mixed traffic will mean intense interaction with all road users such as the human drivers of other vehicles as well as pedestrians and riders of two-wheelers. These interactions (including implicit and explicit communication by humans and CCAM systems) will play a crucial role in the acceptance and thereby the penetration of CCAM systems in future road transport. Call objectives CCAM systems will have to show safe and human-like driving behaviour, so that their decisions and actions can be anticipated easily by all road users, respecting the variety of typical driving behaviour across different countries as well as the need for CCAM systems to respect traffic rules and support road safety. This will require validated models of explicit and implicit human driving behaviour to design and validate such system behaviour. These models will be needed in closed loop simulations of CCAM systems in mixed traffic to realistically represent the reactions of human drivers in other vehicles to the behaviour of a CCAM system. Models representing human driving behaviour are being developed by the projects i4Driving and BERTHA for selected fields of application, i.e. they will be calibrated for a limited number of scenarios. Bringing together and building upon the results of these projects – in particular a simulation library and an innovative methodology to account for uncertainty from i4Driving and a scalable, probabilistic driver behavioural model from BERTHA, research is needed to extend the fields of application that these projects are addressing with a focus on representing driver behaviour in a multitude of safety-critical scenarios, considering the variation and statistical distribution of human behavioural patterns and the factors influencing such behaviour, including the parallel execution of non-driving related tasks. To achieve high degrees of robustness and applicability in a wide range of scenarios, detailed calibration and parameterisation is necessary, as driver behaviour depends on factors such as the road infrastructure, vehicle types, traffic conditions and rules, as well as regional influences and driver experiences / demographics, e.g., gender, age and other relevant social variables. Considering the deviation of average from ideal human driving behaviour, proposed actions must also validate the models for their extended fields of application, going well beyond the applications and degrees of validation accomplished by the above-mentioned projects under HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-03. Proposed actions are thus expected to raise the technology readiness of such models to TRL 5. Data for parameterisation and validation should be captured by monitoring real human drivers in driving simulators and/or real traffic considering what is happening inside and outside the vehicle. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposed actions should integrate, to the extent possible, the validated models in the virtual validation and verification approaches as developed in the projects HEADSTART and SUNRISE and complemented by the project SYNERGIES. Successful integration should be demonstrated in various safety-relevant scenarios as provided by the action(s) funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02. Models should be shared via the federated data exchange platform for CCAM to be developed by an action under HORIZON-CL5-2025-D6-06. Proposals are encouraged to also explore additional fields of application of validated driver behaviour models, while the integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) is expected. To achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged with research stakeholders in Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies as far as possible in capturing data for the parametrisation and validation of behavioural models, while considering regional and cultural differences as well as specificities of respective road infrastructures. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

This analysis should result in a publication with concrete tips helping future project partners integrating implementable, efficient, and well-accepted interdisciplinary practices both within consortia and towards external actors. Organise annual workshops in physical format to allow all pilot project representatives to meet, interact and exchange experiences periodically. Travel costs for all participants are to be covered by this action.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description The overarching policy background is the European Grean Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In the transport area, this translates into a 90% reduction of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To deliver the European Green Deal, there is a need to revise and upgrade numerous policies, including those for transport and large-scale infrastructures. Call objectives The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy (SSMS), which translates this overall transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that such infrastructure should rely on clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, as well as on a modernised grid. Research in this topic should provide knowledge and technical solutions to a triple challenge: (1) limiting emissions of transport infrastructures; (2) making them more resilient to climate change; and (3) addressing environmental and biodiversity aspects. Projects should cover the entire life cycle of transport infrastructures, covering overall emissions from sourcing of materials, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure. Proposals should address all of the following aspects: Development of new methods and techniques to construct, manage, maintain and repair (including self-repair) transport infrastructures, in order to increase climate resilience and lower emissions; Assessment of solutions considering the principles of circularity and taking into account the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) approach; Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the solutions considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure and accompanying business plans for their implementation; Application of innovative materials (e.g. green asphalt, green cement, carbon sinks) that enable transport infrastructures to become more resilient, more sustainable and emit less pollutants; Validation of all the proposed solutions and proofs of concepts is to be carried out in at least two large-scale demonstrations. The demonstrations should cover at least two different transport infrastructure types (e.g., road, rail, waterborne, airport) which are located on at least two different Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. The demonstrations should also cover different environments and phases of the infrastructure life cycle (e.g. design, construction, maintenance, decommissioning); Analysis of EU national and international standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure; Design of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement methods, contributing to lowering the environmental footprint, resources, and material consumption; Demonstration of sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure with nature-based solutions (NBS), minimising the negative effects on the environment, including the degradation of ecosystems, the fragmentation of habitats and the loss of biodiversity. read more Expected effects and impacts The projects should develop clear indicators with baselines and quantified targets in support of the expected outcomes that are monitored for each demonstration site. With regards to the expected outcomes, projects should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation (e.g. revised TEN-T regulation), multi-disciplinary adaptive capacity in line with the European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA) and the Commission Communication on Managing Climate Risks, in particular cascading impacts across sectors. Proposals should consider and build on results from previous calls on resilient and sustainable infrastructure and standards, and should incorporate relevant EU guidance on the development and management of European transport infrastructures. Proposals should also build on previous results from projects on advanced materials, sensor technology, digitalisation, asset management, decision support and automation in the construction and maintenance of infrastructures. If the proposed activities and solutions involve the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and/or techniques, the proposal is expected to demonstrate that robustness of the solution. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: Demonstration of combined solutions for infrastructure construction that achieve the following targets: At least 50% of the construction materials used are recycled or sourced from recycled materials; Reduced pollutant emissions by at least 30% considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure; Reduced degradation of ecosystems and fragmentation of habitats during construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of transport infrastructure (thereby contributing to maintaining biodiversity); Increased climate resilience of infrastructure to extreme weather and human caused events, assuring at least 80% capacity at network level during the disruptions; Structured analysis and recommendations on the need for EU standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure; Guiding document on the necessary adaptations to public procurement rules that contribute to including clear sustainability and resilience award criteria. read more',

    'short description The overarching policy background is the European Grean Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In the transport area, this translates into a 90% reduction of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To deliver the European Green Deal, there is a need to revise and upgrade numerous policies, including those for transport and large-scale infrastructures. Call objectives The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy (SSMS), which translates this overall transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and made resilient to disasters.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description Electronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) platforms established in line with Regulation 2020/1056 will play a central role in facilitating the implementation of business-to-authority (B2A) information exchange processes related to multimodal transport of goods. In line with the Regulation’s requirements, common specifications for a single comprehensive data set and harmonised protocols for data sharing will ensure interoperability of the information shared electronically between actors, and the requirements for rights-based access-control system will establish safeguards for cybersecurity and trust. Call objectives The use of electronic means to exchange regulatory information is also expected to reduce administrative costs for economic operators, to enhance the efficiency of freight transport services and to facilitate green transformation of the logistics sector. Therefore, given their potential, apart from specific B2A functionalities, eFTI platforms could also serve as an enabler for other universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to achieve digital interconnectivity of logistics systems and platforms including in a business-to-business (B2B) perspective. The proposals should unlock the potential of eFTI platforms for further functionalities, beyond the scope of Regulation 2020/1056, to new B2B services and applications as well as other B2A uses. Proposals should refer, as a core principle, to the legislative framework and specific technological solutions provided through Regulation 2020/1056, while duly reflecting the latest technological state of the art for electronic information exchange. Where relevant, and especially in B2B perspective, they should apply and build upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing and exchange in transport, the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF) and the European mobility data space (EMDS). Outside the scope of this topic is any type of architecture, federation of platforms or similar, as these are already delivered by eFTI and DTLF. Proposals also should not develop functionalities already required in the current scope of the eFTI Regulation. Instead, they are expected to leverage and/or extend functionalities of eFTI platforms that are in operation at the time of the implementation of the project, to ensure the effective implementation of new use cases. Building on the functionalities, requirements and implementation specifications for eFTI platforms provided for in the eFTI Regulation and its implementing and delegated acts, the proposals should address all of the following aspects: Develop technical solutions and tools, at least at the level of operational prototype demonstration (TRL7), for complementary applications and services for electronic B2A information sharing; Develop universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to enable electronic B2B information sharing in collaborative logistics processes. The proposed solutions should be implemented with minimal integration effort for industrial stakeholders, for instance through the usage of Artificial Intelligence to facilitate data and information interoperability. Develop solutions and tools to facilitate SMEs engagement in the digital freight transport and logistics ecosystem and the adoption of solutions by SMEs. Define multiple use cases, services and application of eFTI platforms for B2B and B2A processes duly accounting of relevant existing solutions and projects and identifying specific barriers to interoperability and universal adoption. Identify and define relevant data to be added to the existing eFTI common dataset to support the new use cases, services and functionalities; while addressing aspects of data sovereignty, data privacy and cybersecurity, pursuant to the relevant Union legislation; Assess and provide recommendations for B2B framework arrangements, including standard data exchange contracts, identification/authentication and authorisation to ensure trusted operations in data sharing and exchange in freight transport and logistics; Define and seek synergies with relevant EU frameworks and policies related to the exchange of transport emissions data (such as new Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on CountEmissions EU, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and other relevant Union acts) to facilitate their effective and harmonised implementation, including through the establishment of an open source emissions calculators, as well as the exploitation of data sharing frameworks for carbon reporting between operators in the same supply chain; Assess the interdependencies and needs with horizontal Union strategies and legislation such as GDPR, digital identities, data spaces, AI act, Data Governance Act, Cybersecurity Act; identify best practices and provide recommendations for compliance. Define and test B2A and B2B solutions and use cases in at least 2 demonstration environments/ecosystems involving platforms and users. B2B use cases should be led by industry stakeholders, in particular shippers and logistics service providers (e.g. freight forwarders, transportation companies). B2A use cases should be developed in cooperation with industry stakeholders, researchers and public administrations, including statistical offices. Identify and develop best practices, map solutions and value streams. Provide recommendations on incentives, capability building, training and technology adoption support schemes as well as trust building mechanisms – to facilitate, encourage and accelerate the adoption of eFTI platforms and data sharing and exchange innovations by companies and in particular by SMEs. read more Expected results The proposals are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes: Extended functionalities of electronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) platforms beyond the required actions forming part of the implementation of Regulation 2020/1056 for: new use cases, solutions and applications, enabling harmonised electronic business-to-business (B2B) information sharing and exchange in multimodal logistics chains and hubs such as those related to greenhouse gases (GHG) reporting, sustainability claims and other actions leveraging efficient and green freight operations in the supply chain; complementary applications and services for electronic business-to-authority (B2A) information sharing aimed to support the implementation by businesses of relevant Union regulatory frameworks in transport or in other relevant policy fields, such as in the context of smart enforcement, statistics, customs, e-invoicing, sustainability reporting, data spaces, GHG and external costs calculators; Best practices to boost and accelerate the adoption of eFTI framework and data sharing innovations by companies and in particular by SMEs are established; Improved efficiency in operations and freight transport, through the provision of advanced digital connectivity and interoperability of the information shared electronically between actors in both B2B and B2A perspectives, compared to the baseline defined in the start of the project, is demonstrated and quantified; Reduced administrative burden and costs associated with B2B data sharing and B2A regulatory and non-regulatory reporting are demonstrated and quantified. read more',

Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description This topic aims to reduce development costs and time to market of new battery systems by accelerated multi-physical and virtual testing. Call objectives Current test strategies are still very time consuming and costly due to the need to understand the impact of multi-physical operational loads (electric, thermal, mechanical, etc.), potential failure modes, ageing and misuse on the safety and reliability of battery cells and modules. To overcome these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing are required taking into account the most impactful parameters on ageing, reliability and safety and their dependencies. Proposals are expected to address Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries and are encouraged to develop techniques and methodologies which are applicable to other forms of electro-mobility as well as stationary applications (including second life). Proposals are expected to address and demonstrate all the following activities: Understand and describe the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters; Derive advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the-Loop (XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, thermal and mechanical loads at the same time; Combine physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and physical battery testing considering specific applications; Develop simplified test strategies reducing the number of tests and their complexity while improving battery safety and reliability. Synergies between different battery chemistries, including next generation battery designs and sizes must be exploited where possible, allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level; Research activities are also expected to lead to advanced response strategies for damaged and aged batteries. Furthermore, a contribution to the European safety classification system is expected by developing standards for this safety classification. To this end, proposals are expected to establish contact and exploit complementarities with selected proposals under topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-03 “Safe post-crash management of road Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (2ZERO Partnership)” with regards to monitoring techniques for safety risks, algorithms for defining state of health and remaining useful life. Activities covering the following aspects are encouraged: Development of virtual methods for full system validation using physical sub-system results; Development, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell or pack measurement and diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over what is currently available. Definition of performance indicators relating to battery degradation and safety, and development of methods for the validation of digital models. Application of AI and generative AI for the definition of the design of experimental and testing strategies to increase the outcome of experimental testing campaigns, in order to accelerate achievement of significant conclusions, and to thus reduce testing time and effort. read more Expected effects and impacts Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). Proposals are expected to also establish cooperation and complementarity with the selected proposal under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-02-03: “Creating a digital passport to track battery materials, optimise battery performance and life, validate recycling, and promote a new business model based on data sharing (Batt4EU Partnership)” with regards to safety and ageing information as part of the battery passport. Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission''s Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of performing experimental or desk-top research on battery performance and/or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal, or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu) JRC shall assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal). Projects are expected to collaborate and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-D2-02-06. To strengthen the European battery ecosystem, projects are expected to use materials, products and equipment produced in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe, unless it is demonstrated that no valid option exists. The procurement strategies should be described in the proposal, especially and to the furthest extent possible the place of production of the elements.

    'short description While the increased use of sustainable transport modes and multimodal solutions are critical levers for transport, logistics and supply chain decarbonisation, and despite obvious environmental advantages, the modal share of the EU IWT sector has remained below expectations over the last decades. The seamless integration of inland waterway transport in multimodal supply chains requires the physical and digital connection to other land transport modes and maritime transport. Call objectives Digitalisation is not a goal in itself but an important supporting development required to remain competitive and to improve the connectivity to ports, other transport modes and the clients (e.g. to keep the direct costs low and to allow synchromodal solutions). Digital interconnectivity (with logistics systems and other digital platforms for transport) is crucial to increase the modal share of IWT in multimodal logistics chains and to be able to significantly contribute to the modal shift goals as presented in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. Proposals are expected to focus on the integration of smart vessels, smart infrastructure, smart data and smart governance in multimodal logistics chains. The proposals should address all of the following aspects: Building on the results of previous and on-going Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funded projects, identify, develop and test robust technical and operational solutions and tools (also exploring innovative technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence) to connect physically and digitally IWT to existing land and waterborne multimodal logistics chains for a sustainable, efficient, safe, resilient, automated IWT with a view to synchromodal transport; Define and develop key parts of the IWT-related aspects of a common framework for multi-modal data sharing, while enabling compatibility with legacy systems; building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), the European mobility data space (EMDS), the electronic Freight Transport Information regulation; and considering high value datasets, the revised Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Directive and River Information Services (RIS) Directive. Outside of the scope are any type of new platforms or similar; rather, proposals are expected to leverage existing frameworks or platforms to ensure effective use case implementation (e.g. proposed solutions could interface with and be integrated in existing platforms used by shippers, carriers and freight forwarders to connect with multimodal information). Proposals could also identify datasets already available or that could be developed in order to enhance the integration of IWT in multimodal supply chains; Define and test applications and use cases, building on the proposed solutions for advanced cooperative Smart Shipping and Smart Logistics, including integration with the physical infrastructure, in at least four demonstration pilots in actual operational environments (minimum at TRL 7). The pilots should focus on better integrating inland waterway transport in the multimodal supply chains, with a focus on cross border applications, on the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital manner, and on efficient and green operations. The pilots should cover different types of goods, different routes and IWT basins (to have better EU geographical coverage), possibly along the Trans-European Transport Network corridors. To ensure a user and governance perspective approach, the pilot cases should be led by industry stakeholders (e.g. freight forwarders, intermodal operators), in cooperation with shippers and public administrations (involvement of public administrations is considered a priority). The impact of increased automation and digitalisation on all stakeholders should be considered as part of the requirements definition and throughout the design life cycle; Through the pilots and the application of the proposed solutions, analyse the existing relevant regional/national regulations, identify gaps and legal barriers, and propose recommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU level, as well as input for the standardisation and harmonisation of the smart shipping components to the relevant standardisation bodies (e.g. CESNI, CEN, CENELEC); Based on the pilots’ results, assess and quantify, in a comprehensive, structured and substantiated analysis, the environmental, economic and social benefits of smart shipping (including automated vessels and the link to the physical infrastructure), and the effects of increasing the use of IWT in multimodal logistics chains. Develop and propose new business models to incentivise the use of IWT; Foster collaboration among key stakeholders, including transport operators, logistics providers, shippers, policymakers, and technology developers, also by implementing communication activities and organising an outreach event displaying the pilots’ results and the demonstrated advantages of integrating IWT in multimodal logistic chains read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Enhanced solutions and tools to better integrate inland waterway transport (IWT) into the overall logistic chains and increase the modal share of inland waterway transport, are developed and demonstrated in use cases in line with the objectives set up in NAIADES III; Gains (compared to the baseline defined in the beginning of the project) in terms of operational efficiency, as well as environmental and social impact from the integration of IWT in multimodal logistics chains, are clearly identified, demonstrated and measured; Recommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU level, as well as input for related standardisation, harmonisation and amendments to Inland Water Transport Digitalisation Vision to reflect findings from the project; Stakeholder engagement and communication campaigns and events to increase visibility and use of IWT are organised. read more',

    'short description There is a pressing need to measure accurately the different types of emissions in coastal and port environments located near to cities, because of their negative impact on the environment and human health. Ports, as intricate environments showcasing a variety of vessels including novel designs, pose a challenge to the development of standardised technologies capable of collecting and assessing real-time pollutant emissions data from these ships docking at ports. This is vital for enforcing emissions limits and validating the data for enforcement purposes. Call objectives Emissions in ports stem from other sources, such as port operations (e.g., cargo handling, towing, fuel storage, and bunkering) or even other industrial activities (directly or indirectly linked to transport, e.g., fisheries) taking place within the port area. Additionally, ports are frequently situated near industrial zones, making it crucial to possess an accurate and, where possible, real-time understanding of the types, origins, and intensity of pollutant and noise emissions generated in and around a port area. The shift from heavy fuel oils to alternative fuels in the context of the regulatory framework set to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal requires further research actions; recent evidence from research and monitoring projects has shown that new fuels being considered and GHG emission-control technologies used on-board vessels may result in emissions of other harmful pollutants that are not sufficiently controlled. In some cases, unexpected side effects of emission abatement may arise which might require regulatory action. Further to such undesired releases, it is crucial to ensure that vessels comply with regulations in force, in coastal areas, at open sea and in inland waterways. Projects under call LC-MG-1-1-2018 of Horizon 2020 showed that remote measurement of SOx emissions using stationary or mobile techniques can significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of compliance monitoring. It is important to explore whether remote or on-board techniques can be extended to the monitoring of additional pollutants such as CH4, NOx, N2O, NH3, UFP, BC, formaldehyde, PM, as well as the Particle Number (PN), NPAHs and to provide internationally harmonised methods and reporting procedures where such measurements can be used within an enhanced compliance monitoring framework in the future. These methods should also have the potential to be used as evidence for law enforcement to enable independent prosecution of violations. Furthermore, there is a need to develop engine testing procedures that better represent operational patterns in order for the emission values from test cycles to accurately represent real emissions. Limited surveillance measurements at open seas show a different compliance (lower compliance) behaviour for sulphur emissions compared to measurements in coastal regions. Therefore, it is important to identify risk areas for violations and to establish techniques for monitoring in these areas as well. It is of equally great importance to develop harmonised/standardised monitoring methods that could be used as evidence for sanctions in the future. Assessment of the real-world performance of emission control, in particular for Tier III vessels, is therefore required to make sure that current NOx regulations achieve and sustain the emission reductions that these regulations are designed for. Further, certification testing should be modified to better address real world conditions. Moreover, potential ammonia slip from urea consumption needs to be identified, and N2O emission levels need to be determined to ensure that GHG reduction efforts are not thwarted. In addition, no established method for identifying NOx emissions that exceed existing standards under real sailing operation is currently in place. Based on different remote or on-board measurement techniques, harmonised methods, and reporting procedures to identify exceedances of expected emission levels needs to be designed and put in action, at least for informative reasons – as no enforcement of low NOx under real operation is currently in place. With CH4 being a potent GHG, any uncontrolled releases from LNG powered vessels significantly compromise any lower carbon benefits of the LNG as a fuel. Moreover, although boil-off gas (BOG) should be reliquefied or used on-board, records of BOG release to the atmosphere have been reported. The extent of any remaining current problem needs to be identified and measurements on methane slip from actual vessels need to identify the extent of emissions, considering potential needs for methane emission limits (for the engines as well as for the fuel storage onboard and the bunkering process). The problem with methane slip will also remain with the use of bio-methane as fuel. New fuels are considered in the effort to decarbonise shipping, with the most prominent being ammonia (NH3), methanol (MeOH) and hydrogen. There is currently limited evidence on new pollution dimensions induced by such fuels, including ultrafine particles of non-carbonaceous origin, N2O and NH3 emissions, NPAH, Formaldehyde PM, NOx, etc. Measurements on actual marine engines and vessels using such fuels need to provide new evidence in the pool of data forming so that early measures are taken before such new fuels become widespread in actual use, in case such new emissions prove to be at a level that constitute health hazards or environmental risks. Zero carbon fuels like NH3 and H2, as well as dual-fuel engines and CO2 capture onboard require different remote measurement methods, since CO2 is no longer a stable and dominant reference gas in the exhaust plume. Alternative options in sensing and calculation method need to be introduced. Demonstration must be undertaken within a real operational environment. In the collection and analysis of remote as well as static sensing data for the monitoring of emissions and air pollutants, the accuracy of the sensors and the quality and verifiability of the data obtained are of particular importance. Potential risks and problems in data collection and sensor technology, in particular as regards the identification of the source of the pollution, should be analysed in detail. A verifiable methodology is also required for processing and interpreting the data in the next step. Issues such as access to data, data storage and associated security aspects (including the assessment of cyber security of interoperable systems) should be fully considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR. To address all these highlighted issues, proposals are expected to undertake all the following R&I activities: Map high emission activities and demonstrate port, coastal, inland and open sea monitoring techniques for at least NOx, BC, N2O, UFP, NH3, CH4,, PM as well as PN and NMVOC (or any other related pollutants), during normal operation of ships which includes dynamic engine loads of all ship types (including port service vessels) and suitable for zero carbon fuels, dual-fuel engines and carbon capture. All the emission measurements should be integrated through static and remote sensing in order to share data; Demonstration of the developed measuring technologies in 6 different TEN-T ports, (of which 3 Core and 3 Comprehensive ports, covering at least three sea basins of the Black, Mediterranean, North Sea, N. Atlantic and Baltic Seas). Out of these 6 ports at least one should be classified as a TEN-T inland-waterway only port according to Annex II of the TEN-T Regulation. At least one of the ports should be situated in a city participating in the Cities Mission and activities should feed into the implementation of the Climate City Contract (CCC), with abatement measures and port-city collaborative governance approaches to match or enhance CCC commitments. The selection of ports should be such as to cover a wide range of emission profiles and take into consideration the complexity of emission sources in order to ensure that the outcome is representative and can be replicated to other ports; Identify, differentiate and measure in real time at or near possible sources of emissions (e.g., individual vessel, specific port operations, industrial installations within and very close to the port area) under complex (geographical, layout, mixed space uses and other) conditions and variable weather conditions. The calibration of the measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated; Development of a methodology for assessing pollution within the port area including emissions from all transport modes, port operations and industries located in the port area; Identify the impact of emissions in ports and nearby cities and propose mitigating measures and plans for municipalities and port authorities, including ports in which municipalities are not directly involved in the management of port authorities and terminals; Development of Real-Time Decision Support Systems (RT DSS) for ships, onboard ship operations, ship operators to look into data collected to enable port and maritime authorities to make decisions about rebates; Development of harmonised monitoring techniques and an automatic reporting and verification system solution helping shipowners to comply with current and future EU and international regulation as well as public authorities to monitor and control emissions from the data exchanged; Harmonise/standardise monitoring techniques and reporting (taking also into consideration the CountEmissions EU rules) with the potential to be used for legal prosecution; develop recommendations for improved certification and testing for real world situations; Increase evidence to feed pool of data for regulated and non-regulated pollutants from vessels; Identify pollutants from new fuels used for shipping decarbonisation; Develop protocol(s) for the measurement of BC, UFP, and PN from vessels; Develop engine testing methods to better mimic real-world emissions and propose a vessel grading system methodology with respect to its emissions comparable to EURO classification of road vehicles. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals should demonstrate how they will engage with authorities and local communities in disseminating results in proportion to their expected impacts. Relevant authorities include the European Commission, the Bonn Agreement, Helcom, the IMO, and national, regional, and local competent authorities etc. while local communities are primarily, but not limited to, major port cities and coastal areas in the EU. Proposals are encouraged to explore and use the results from previous EU-funded projects such as SCIPPER (Horizon 2020), EMERGE (Horizon 2020) and Green C Ports (CEF), Interreg Clean North Sea Shipping and LIFE CLINSH (CLean Inland SHipping) as well as develop complementarities with relevant activities funded under the Horizon Europe call on “Advanced transport emissions monitoring networks” (HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-18) and activities developing satellite-based measurements (Cluster 4 Destination 5 (Space) and EUSPA), focusing on remaining gaps not covered by these projects. Duplication of activities should be avoided. Proposals are encouraged to include and consider the fisheries sectors and fishing vessels, considering their potential intersections with the use of alternative fuels in ports when relevant. Consideration of projects such as HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-05 and PPPA-2024-FISHVESSELDEMO may prove beneficial. The funded projects should share their experience and good practices with the projects selected under the topic of the EU Ocean & Waters Mission on “Restoring waterfront cities and their ports /maritime infrastructures (HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-05) and links should also be established with the projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-SPACE-2025-01-46: Innovative Earth observation services in support of maritime litter detection and ship source pollution policies. This topic has been co-programmed and is contributing to the implementation of the Zero-Emission Waterborne Transport (ZEWT) partnership and of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission. read more Expected results To support the Zero Pollution Action Plan and the Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy as well as the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Real-time demonstration of on-board tamper-proof and remote measurement techniques for a wide range of pollutants (including pollutants from alternative fuels and non-regulated pollutants) from vessel emissions, allowing shipowners to measure the emissions during operation and contributing to the current monitoring and enforcing activities of public authorities, such as port and maritime authorities and with the potential to be used for future compliance monitoring; Development of broadly accepted harmonised methods to measure real sailing emissions, including coastal, open seas and inland waterway with potential to be used for future compliance monitoring; Development of an automatic reporting and verification system solution that helps shipping companies to comply with current and future regulation and for maritime, inland and port authorities to monitor and control the actual ship emissions derived from the data exchanged; Contribution to the delivery of better emission factors for emissions inventories and projections, especially for harmful substances and fuel mixtures for which little knowledge exists today and ultimately contributing to the establishment of a broadly accepted method for measuring and calculating real sailing emissions of a ship; Identification of real-world releases of harmful substances which are currently not controlled by regulations and excessive releases of substances already controlled in open seas and in-port activities; Innovative technologies and systems to monitor, measure and identify the source of pollution in ports beyond vessels, including other transport modes, port operations and industries active in the port environment are made available for public authorities; Recommendations for improved certification and testing to better cover real world situations; Support of local, regional, national and international emissions reduction and air quality plans and noise action plans by providing real-world emission information and measuring the actual impact of control measures and strategies on concentrations and/or deposition of pollutants; Identification of risk areas for potential violations to emission limits. read more',

At least one of the ports must be situated in a city participating in the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission. The demonstration activities must take place in a real operational environment. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.

    'short description Data sharing plays a pivotal role in supporting R&I, enabling deployment, and enhancing the competitiveness of the CCAM industry. Within the realm of data sharing, there are two distinct categories of data that are particularly pertinent: mobility data, and data for research and development. Call objectives The common European mobility data space aims to facilitate mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, including trustworthy AI integration). Several data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&I initiatives. The FAME project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&I projects. Several CCAM Partnership R&I projects expressed interest in making data available and reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE and SYNERGIES. However, this integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and governed by the Data Space Support Centre. In parallel, the DeployEMDS builds a decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe. Consequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena and AWARE2ALL have generated valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks. By establishing robust interfaces, ontologies, and data management architectures, the CCAM research community and industry can effectively utilise and repurpose existing data, thereby reducing costs, and facilitating the development and validation of CCAM solutions, including the creation of digital twins through synthetic data. The enhanced sharing of data across the CCAM stakeholders should also benefit national authorities, and operators in their efforts to collect KPIs to monitor wider impacts of CCAM solutions including on safety, economy, and society. read more Expected effects and impacts Proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects: Identify how to further evolve the data spaces for CCAM applications, connecting existing dataspaces and bridging data gaps; Identify harmonisation and standardisation needs for taxonomies, interfaces, and data formats to push CCAM data exchange and extend and implement the CCAM taxonomies in the CCAM Test Data Space; Identify information needs and reference data for KPIs collected from Member States and Associated Countries (where relevant and to the extent possible) of i.e. high-level socio-economic statistics, accidents, infrastructure, vehicles; Establish a Federated CCAM Data Exchange Platform with tools and governance, including a viable business model to ensure the durability of the platform, which facilitates sharing of data for industry, social partners, authorities and academia that are supporting specific use cases related to: large-scale demonstrations, generation and maintenance of digital twins and representation of scenarios (for development or validation), performance and safety assessment, driver behaviour data from real and synthetic driving conditions, ADS regulation monitoring, AI model training, and common information source for national/EU level statistics and Key Performance Indicators; Identify and describe methods/algorithms/processes to refine and use data for the specific use cases tackled by the Platform; Identify the effects of the EU General Data Protection Legislation (GDPR) on AI learning workflows and possible mitigation measures. A strong alignment with the common European mobility data space and related projects is expected. The work should ensure coherence and interoperability with other common European data spaces, especially regarding its cross-sectoral blueprint and building blocks, by aligning with the Data Spaces Support Centre and by using, as far as possible, the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl. The work should build on the outcomes of the FAME project and the FAME Test Data Space (Data Sharing - Connected Automated Driving). Finally, links with related activities under the future European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC) for Mobility and Logistics Data and cooperation with the CCAM Partnership’s States Representative Group (SRG) is expected. Particular attention should be dedicated towards establishing interoperability standards for data sharing within and across data ecosystems, through the implementation of the FAIR data principles and leveraging already adopted practices, especially in relevant European common data spaces. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Overview of CCAM-specific limitations of current data exchange solutions and existing dataspaces related to interfaces, harmonised ontologies and taxonomies, standards, formats, monetisation / compensation; Mapping of information and reference data needs for KPIs collected by Member States and Associated Countries (where relevant and to the extent possible), related to impacts of CCAM technologies and solutions; Federated sustainable CCAM Data Exchange Platform that facilitates sharing of data for both large-scale demonstrations and deployment, interfacing existing data spaces and improving the exchange, availability, and accessibility of data for the development, testing and deployment of CCAM services (including but not limited to Digital Twins, digital scenario representations, safety assurance and validation, ADS regulation monitoring, driver behaviour, AI model training, and the collection of national/EU level statistics and Key Performance Indicators); Proposed governance structure for the Data Exchange Platform with a sustainability plan and viable business model. read more',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description CCAM-enabled vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings on road conditions, location, nearby vehicles and infrastructure. Such data is shared in real-time, while data from other sources is received. This needs powerful and optimised large data processing algorithms, which requires large amounts of computing power, data processing, real-time operation and high levels of security. Call objectives Most existing AI computing tasks for automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware. To encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential. Complementarities with projects funded under Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative. Edge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are essential in safety-critical situations. To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: For next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and complex AI models. Thus, it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM and AIthena. Develop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from projects such as SYNERGIES. The development and demonstration use case should include in-vehicle perception and understanding, such as object detection, segmentation, road surface tracking, sign and signal recognition, etc. Decision making and actuation of countermeasures is to be part of the chain of actions. The approaches for these building blocks and enabling technologies should facilitate a quick uptake in adjacent or following projects; Optimisation of the models for edge deployment. This involves adjusting the size and complexity of models to allow it to run on the relevant edge devices and include training and verification approaches. Techniques such as model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can be used to reduce the size of AI models without significant loss in performance. Additionally, over-the-air (OTA) updates can be used to manage and update models across a fleet of devices efficiently; Develop tools and approaches for edge-AI model monitoring, to ensure that edge-AI systems continue to operate as expected and ensure resilience to failure conditions or attacks, and monitoring model outputs to ensure they are accurate even as real-life conditions and datasets change. read more Expected effects and impacts The research will require due consideration of cyber security, connectivity and both personal and non-personal data protection rules, including compliance with the GDPR, and ensure that gender and other social categories (such as but not limited to disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic or racial origin, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections are duly considered where appropriate, as well as Explainable AI to enhance trust and regulatory compliance including alignment with the AI Act. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies in edge AI approaches for mobility and for CCAM, as well as its integration into the vehicle architecture.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description The initial deployment of Level 4 automated vehicle services in urban and other complex settings has encountered significant challenges in environmental perception and decision-making, leading to occasional remote assistance calls, blockages and accidents that have impacted public trust. At the same time, the increasing computing power demand is in conflict with a limited usage of energy and resources to meet sustainability requirements. Call objectives Emerging large-scale demonstrations of automated vehicles should be accompanied by objective-oriented research aimed at addressing these challenges directly, while targeting improvements in performance, accuracy, reliability, and cyber-security. To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects: Advancements in all steps of the sense-control-act process for both vehicle- and infrastructure-based smart sensor systems and networks, controllers, and actuators to ensure safety and trustworthiness of CCAM, as well as facilitating effective disruption management; Utilisation of digital enabling technologies including, for example: AI at-the-edge, machine learning, data spaces with reference scenarios and suitable software architectures; Adoption of modular, reusable, and open software platforms supporting the environment perception for CCAM while ensuring transparency of operation, verification, and safety assessment to build trust, with respect to authorities, decision makers and the public via direct performance explainability; Energy efficiency, circularity, and eco-design of the environment perception systems by decreasing potential energy and resource consumption in both production and operation as well as facilitating reusability, reparability and upgradability while further enhancing the performance; Reduction of potential costs of environment perception systems through scalability, modularity and standardisation, making technologies financially viable for widespread implementation; Support remote assistance as a stepping-stone towards higher levels of autonomy and vehicle automation in wider Operational Design Domains (ODD). read more Expected effects and impacts Solutions are expected to integrate electronic hardware architectures and software stacks in a co-design approach. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that solutions use, as far as possible, building blocks and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, e.g., on the hardware abstraction layer and SDV middleware and API framework. Results from projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-04 and complementarities with projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” should also be considered, where appropriate. As the activities should demonstrate feasibility and their full potential for real-world applications, proposals should foresee exchanges with other relevant EU or national projects for e.g., coordinated validation, transport systems integration and large-scale piloting. Collaboration should also be sought with projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-01 and other directly relevant call topics. In view of the relevance of environment perception and decision-making of automated vehicles for the responsiveness of the innovation to diverse societal interests and concerns, accessibility, inclusiveness as well as regulation, proposals should consider societal, ethical, socio-economical and/ or legal aspects as far as feasible in the requirements of the technical solutions to be developed. This could involve the engagement of institutional users as well as citizen-science approaches, e.g., in collaboration with projects CulturalRoad and Diversify – CCAM. To achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is highly relevant, considering the lessons learned in this area (for example, from robo-taxi and freight transport trials in the US and China). Activities should foster links between the European ecosystem and relevant stakeholders around the world, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries, while taking into account the legal, cultural, historical, and social aspects in Europe as well as other specificities of the European road network and cities (including: traffic rules, user behaviour, diverse user groups considering gender, age, disability, socio-economic status, streets morphology, and the structure and condition of roads in rural areas). This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: Availability of validated prototypes of next-generation vehicle and infrastructure-based environment perception technologies for robust, reliable and trustworthy CCAM operations to anticipate and avoid foreseeable risks and unexpected safety-critical situations in complex real-world conditions (e.g., at pedestrian crossings, in construction sites, during interactions with emergency vehicles, etc.); Understanding the degree (and limits) to which automated CCAM perception systems can anticipate, process, and respond to on-site ‘early-warnings’ (e.g., street design, sounds, smells and other signals from the environment, weather conditions, intentions of pedestrians, cyclists, and other active mobility users, etc.); Improvement of the energy-efficiency of the sense-think-act systems of CCAM considering the vehicle, the infrastructure, the cloud at-the-edge, while at the same time increasing the performance to guarantee security and error-free reliability; these developments will contribute to the reduction of the potential climate and environmental footprints of CCAM systems; Standardisation and adoption of modular, reusable, and upgradable software and hardware platforms, investigating scalable deployment concepts that lead to cost reduction and improved affordability while adopting a circular, eco-design approach (including efficient materials use, reduced waste, and the repair and reuse of components where feasible). read more',

    'short description The share of trips made by active modes is increasing, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This increase is linked to cities actively placing more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved infrastructure. Call objectives Pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities. Proposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects: Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions; Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users; Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight; Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles; Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles; Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a draft European regulatory framework on the type-approval of micromobility vehicles or self-certification based on harmonised standards; Identify, define and pilot test the following in at least two clearly identified real-life urban environments: new geometric designs of infrastructure to ensure safe, seamless, and comfortable mobility for pedestrians, cyclists and users of micromobility modes while accounting for the increasing demand, higher operating speeds and weight and size of e-bikes, e-scooters and all types of micromobility devices; smart technologies (V2X) to assess their effectiveness in preventing and decreasing conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility modes users and motorised traffic; road safety requisites, requirements, rules and/or regulations that could be put in place by local authorities in order to increase the take-up and the safety of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups, by 20% compared to the baseline at the start of the project; development of a comprehensive, real-time information platform for cyclists that includes data on route accessibility, signage, and infrastructure conditions. Special focus should be paid to supporting the safety of user groups with particular vulnerability including people with disabilities (physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, sensory, etc). read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals are invited to explain how the work supports local/regional/national authorities’ efforts to deliver on the objectives of the Vision Zero Strategy, the Strategic Action Plan on Road Safety and the EU Road Safety Policy Framework 2021-2030 as well as on the integration of road safety policies and programmes in Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning.

    'short description The share of trips made by active modes is increasing, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This increase is linked to cities actively placing more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved infrastructure. Call objectives Pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities. Proposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects: Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions; Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users; Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight; Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles; Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles; Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a draft European regulatory framework on the type-approval of micromobility vehicles or self-certification based on harmonised standards; Identify, define and pilot test the following in at least two clearly identified real-life urban environments: new geometric designs of infrastructure to ensure safe, seamless, and comfortable mobility for pedestrians, cyclists and users of micromobility modes while accounting for the increasing demand, higher operating speeds and weight and size of e-bikes, e-scooters and all types of micromobility devices; smart technologies (V2X) to assess their effectiveness in preventing and decreasing conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility modes users and motorised traffic; road safety requisites, requirements, rules and/or regulations that could be put in place by local authorities in order to increase the take-up and the safety of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups, by 20% compared to the baseline at the start of the project; development of a comprehensive, real-time information platform for cyclists that includes data on route accessibility, signage, and infrastructure conditions. Special focus should be paid to supporting the safety of user groups with particular vulnerability including people with disabilities (physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, sensory, etc). read more Expected effects and impacts Proposals are invited to explain how the work supports local/regional/national authorities’ efforts to deliver on the objectives of the Vision Zero Strategy, the Strategic Action Plan on Road Safety and the EU Road Safety Policy Framework 2021-2030 as well as on the integration of road safety policies and programmes in Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning. Proposals should plan for an active collaboration with the well-recognised initiatives in the field of road safety and urban mobility such as the European Road Safety Observatory and the CIVITAS initiative. In addition, proposals should demonstrate that the proposed approaches build upon the results from previous research actions and liaise and collaborate with the projects that will be selected under topic “HORIZON-MISS-2025-06-CIT-CANCER-01: Walking and cycling: increasing their modal share to reap health benefits and emission reductions and integrating active mobility and micro-mobility devices, with smart technologies and infrastructure”.

    'short description One of the principles of the Safe System Approach is to turn from mainly re-active to pro-active management of road safety, i.e. not to derive needs for intervention primarily from crash investigations, but to intervene before serious crashes happen. The ubiquitous gathering of ever-growing amounts of data and their processing in the digital transport system support this idea providing valuable information on traffic situations and events. Call objectives Potential data sources include amongst others: smart phones, wearables, connected vehicles, drones, road-side sensors (e.g. camera, radar), etc. Progress in computing power, in the accuracy of location services and in video analytics are further enablers in the processing and analysis of such data in order to identify safety-critical situations or conflicts based on surrogate safety metrics. In terms of crash prediction modelling artificial intelligence has the potential to identify the underlying risk and the complex relationships between large and diverse datasets which in turn could lead to the identification of crash contributing factors and their interrelations. The identification of these risk factors may then allow predicting safety-critical situations at quantifiable risk levels and guide the proactive implementation of crash avoidance measures, as proposed amongst others by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ideally, interventions would be feasible in real-time and increase the safety of all road users. Proposals should address all the following aspects: Development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin of traffic and infrastructure. This would integrate historical, current, and forecast data, including crowdsourcing and infrastructure sensors, infrastructure topology and condition, along with environmental (e.g. local weather and visibility) and road and traffic conditions. Such a digital twin can allow monitoring and preventively optimising both safety and traffic flow, equally addressing congestion and resilience issues. Results from existing projects like OMICRON could be considered. The proposals should also explore the possibility and usefulness of other type of data such as sociodemographic and economic data, behavioural driving data, data from security cameras, among others that could be provided by third parties (tourism, planned events, demand, etc.); Analyse in detail the technical challenges associated with the acquisition and use of adequate and reliable big data from multiple sensors in the road transport system, as well as the process of combining these datasets in ways that are meaningful for proactive road safety analysis; Develop methods and tools to predict safety-critical traffic situations at quantifiable risk levels based on real-time and historical data; Account for biases in the datasets and ensure that the developed AI-based models or algorithms are bias-free, so that the safety of all road users will be improved effectively in a fair, non-discriminatory way; Analyse in detail also the non-technical challenges associated with this approach and the inherent need to collect and share large amounts of data that can be used to identify and quantify road safety-related risk factors. Ethical, legal and economic issues should be considered and concepts be developed to overcome these challenges in terms of privacy concerns, questions of data ownership, organisational barriers etc; Analyse what real-time countermeasures can be taken to reduce instantaneous risk levels for all road users complementary to existing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) services; Demonstrate the feasibility of such risk predictions and targeted interventions; Build consensus among relevant stakeholders on possible routes for deployment in coordination with other ITS services. Particular attention should be dedicated on establishing interoperability standards for data sharing, through the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and leveraging on already adopted practices especially those in the relevant Common European data spaces. Ways to leverage valuable complementary data, e.g. metadata from crash databases, should also be explored, as well as links to initiatives for European data spaces.

    'short description The field of aircraft icing is of particular importance because it relates to the safety of flight facing adverse weather conditions, which became increasingly extreme during the last decade. Call objectives The aviation industry is working to develop clean and sustainable aviation. There is the need to innovate while maintaining safety. To enable design, validation and future certification of new technologies emerging from cleaner aviation, R&I should be initiated on the following three principal areas ( proposals should consider addressing all, or significant areas of all, three areas): 1. R&I to prepare for the development of means of compliance for certification of future sustainable aviation concepts including: Development of reliable numerical tools to be used to validate the designs against the icing environment of Appendix C, O, P and snow, including ground anti-icing fluids; Development of Supercooled Large Drop (SLD) Testing Capabilities such as icing wind tunnel test or ice tankers. Generation of flight-testing open datasets for validation of modelling and tunnel testing; Development of European Ice Crystal test Capability (for engine/air data probe); Development of Falling / Blowing Snow Testing Capability. 2. R&I on Icing environment to assess the impact of the climate change effects on the certification icing environments. 3. R&I related to new technologies for Ice detection and protection, including: Ice crystal and SLDs Ice Detection systems to optimise Ice crystals protection or support the detect and exit the SLD appendix O or a portion of the appendix O conditions; High Efficiency/Low Energy protection: cleaner aviation with more electric airplanes will drive the need for new ice protection technology: more effective and with less energy, active, passive and hybrid technologies (e.g., low ice-adhesion durable coatings and including new air mobility products (e.g., low speed propeller icing concerns); Dissimilar means for Air data (angle of attack (AOA)/Speed) measurement and insensitive to icing threat.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport represent around 25% of total man-made GHG emissions and continue to grow. The negative impact of these is further strengthened by the existence of other external costs of transport, including air pollution, noise, congestion and accidents. The EU, Member States and industry have made considerable efforts to reduce transport-related GHG emissions and associated external costs. Call objectives Accurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through: Regulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime), Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation), Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU MRV) and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU), and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive); Relevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” (COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting & Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions in Transport” (CLEVER); Standardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards; Regular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport; Industry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global logistics sector. Building on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure that: The full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and consistent way; Relevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically clarified and closed; Any detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU framework; New technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in developing datasets and methodologies; Relevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information. The Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services. read more Expected effects and impacts The proposals should address all of the following aspects: Explore, assess and establish the state of the art regarding issues of measuring and calculating specific types of transport-related emissions for which there is no clear consensus on the market, in particular: black carbon emissions, which primarily result from the combustion of fossil fuels in compression ignition engines; radiative forcing, which has been suggested as having a strong supplementary climate impact at high altitude and is already included in an inconsistent manner across some, but not all, transport GHG reporting programs; GHG emissions from vehicle manufacturing and scrappage, which, although not directly linked to transport operations, do contribute to overall life cycle transport emissions; GHG emissions that result from the installation of transport infrastructure, which would need to include the definition of rules for the combination of operational and life cycle emission calculations into a meaningful and consistent presentation format; GHG emissions related to the maintenance operations associated with transport operations that are currently excluded; GHG emissions from information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and data servers that support the delivery of transport operations. Clarify specific methodological issues for enabling more accurate quantification of emissions and setting proper incentives towards efficient and sustainable transport options, addressing in particular: a detailed methodology for GHG emissions stemming from temperature-controlled transport and cool chain operations; allocation of GHG air transport emissions across passengers and freight transported on the same aircraft. Based on relevant European/national/sectorial repositories, explore, assess and contribute to an EU core dataset of default values for GHG emissions intensity of transport services, including for supporting relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU); Building on the results of the CLEVER project, where relevant, update the list of applicable GHG emission factors for emissions stemming from energy production, distribution and use, in particular in the context of relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU). Consistency with data and methodologies in current energy legislation such as Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive must be ensured; Define R&I gaps on emissions accounting of transport and provide scientifically sound recommendations to address those gaps to improve the existing GHG emissions measuring framework.

If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description The project should benefit from the direct participation of energy communities, smart appliances manufacturers, home energy devices manufacturers, home and building energy management system developers, Distribution System Operators (DSOs), and aggregators. Call objectives The project should: Develop innovative and open-source tools for managing shared energy community assets (e.g., energy storage facilities) and optimising energy community management (e.g., selection and switching of aggregators, preparation and trading of smart contracts, peer-to-peer and energy sharing, self-consumption); Develop open-source tools for forecasting, prediction and advanced data analysis using AI tools and in-depth data analysis for customers and prosumers for autonomous optimisation of consumption, production, storage, smart devices (appliances), and electric vehicle (EV) both at household and energy community levels; Extend DSO SCADA and substation systems for autonomous control of grid assets and seamlessly integrate these systems with home and building energy management systems for direct and fast control and data acquisition to implement local (distribution) grid services (constrain alleviation, grid reconfiguration, restoration of supply, maintenance, and enhancement of energy quality), real-time assessment and monetisation of the use of grid resources; Integrate the three elements above as a basis to establish a platform for cooperation between individual customers or prosumers, entire energy communities, wide area aggregators, and DSOs to provide, acquire, and settle energy system-oriented services (system-wide balancing, support of frequency regulation). The cooperation platform should be based on a plug-and-play integration of the energy community eco-system components (hardware and software), using and extending relevant communication standards and data models. The integration mechanism should be embedded within the core systems used by customers/prosumers, DSO (and TSO), aggregators and market operators, fully aligned with SGAM; Develop tailored security solutions for private and public communication networks used by IoT apps and devices (smart appliances) across energy carriers; Ensure the follow-up and implementation of EU policy measures, including by conducting quality assessments and introducing national community energy targets; Foster institutional allies at local and regional levels; Provide access to and capacities for using digital planning tools; Identify the barriers for network operators (e.g. legal, economic, regulatory etc.) who want to introduce smart consumption options for their customers. Preferably semantically interoperable interactions, as enabled by the ETSI SAREF ontologies, are used. Furthermore, the project should follow the IEC TR 63097 Smart Grid Roadmap, and where relevant, the developed solutions should be open for off-shelf integration using common communication and data standards. In order to comply with Article 33, 36 and 54 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, TSOs or DSOs participating in this project should not own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities or recharging points for electric vehicles. Moreover, the role of the distribution system operator in facilitating peer to peer trading should be without prejudice to the rules in Article 35 Directive (EU) 2019/944. read more Expected effects and impacts The developed solutions have to be tested within, at least, three energy communities from different European countries, preferably in regions with different socio-economic development contexts and different resource availabilities. Technical and social characteristics should be used in the project to validate the developed solutions'' credibility. The demonstration sites should cover complex and technologically advanced energy communities, each located within the range of neighbouring secondary substations supplying a variety of customers/prosumers with close-to-autarky local energy generation, a range of energy vectors, a significant share of storage facilities, and flexible topology already available or to be achieved as an integral part of the project. The secondary substation should be already equipped with advanced monitoring and control systems. In order to increase the replication potential of the deployed solutions the three energy communities are invited to closely collaborate with similar energy communities. The selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative and actively participate in its activities. Additional contributions to the ‘Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation’ (AIOTI) and other relevant activities (e.g., clusters of digital projects and coordinating actions) might be considered when relevant. In particular, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. read more Expected results Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Integration of home and building assets in an efficient way based on common Internet of Things (IoT) communication standards for smart homes and using SGAM architecture and data models (e.g., IEC CIM) for load, generation and storage devices; Facilitate local energy trading and distributed grid-oriented services using micro market and transactions (e.g., peer-to-peer) and improve the market participation for citizens; Enhance the integration of energy communities in European energy grids and increase the renewable energy share and use of flexibility by providing transparent and efficient market-based cost sharing mechanisms; Increase the security of data exchange, for prosumer and customer resources, and independent (commercial) asset operators; Increase synergies using a cross-sectoral approach (e.g., electricity, gas, mobility, heating/cooling) at the level of citizens and/or energy communities; Empower local governments and intermediaries, strengthen overall community energy policies in EU Member States and enhance tool accessibility and user capacity at local level to promote a decentralised and co-owned energy transition. read more',

After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description The EU’s Offshore Strategy underlines that the deployment of offshore wind should be based on maritime spatial planning, assessing the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the installations in a life-cycle perspective, while ensuring co-existence with other activities such as commercial and recreational uses of the sea and fishing. At the same time, it calls for research on the cumulative impacts of offshore energy generation on the environment, which was also underlined in the Communication on Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions (2023). Call objectives Proposals are expected to address at least five of the following aspects: Provide better knowledge and understanding of the cumulative environmental impacts of the offshore wind energy deployment according to the EU targets, when added to the current and planned human activities carried out in the same areas; Expand existing studies, field monitoring, and analysis from local to larger areas, and from site- or species-specific impacts to more general ones. Further develop and deploy field monitoring activities, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems and their services, as well as pollution, from installation to decommissioning and possible repowering, including operational phase and maintenance activities; Test and demonstrate field monitoring and modelling technologies that allow to go beyond state-of-knowledge, regarding life-cycle environmental impacts of offshore wind energy deployments; Improve instruments and models for Maritime Spatial Planning, and environmental assessments at plan and project level that are in alignment with public authorities’ needs; Improve modelling capacity and environmental impact assessments of future offshore wind deployment; Support the identification of areas where wind energy deployment is particularly suitable without significant environmental impact and areas where on the contrary, it should be avoided; Identify strategies, test, and demonstrate technologies that avoid, minimise, mitigate and compensate the environmental impact of bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy systems, propose mitigation and restoration measures and if feasible, provide net-positive environmental impacts. The activities carried out under this point are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project. Particular attention must be dedicated to ensuring that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) and to leveraging existing community practices for data sharing especially those in the relevant European common data spaces and in the European Research infrastructures. Complementarities with other ongoing and upcoming Horizon Europe projects are expected to be ensured as well as with the European Digital Twin of Ocean (European DTO) and its core infrastructure, for instance the projects funded under topics: HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-CLIMATE-02: The ocean-climate-biodiversity-people nexus: uncovering safe operating space for safeguarding the integrity and health of the global ocean; HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-08: EU Digital Twin Ocean: Contribution to the EU DTO core infrastructure through applications for sustainable ocean management; HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-06: Innovative nature-inclusive concepts to reconcile offshore renewables with ocean protection; HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-08: Integration of socio-ecological models into the Digital Twin Ocean; HORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-02-08 Minimisation of environmental, and optimisation of socio-economic impacts in the deployment, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind farms. In addition to considering the most evident environmental impacts of offshore wind energy systems (displacement, collision risk, exposure to aerial and underwater noise, habitat loss and degradation, pollution, etc.), funded projects must include an analysis of possible new impacts, that may become particularly relevant when a high number of wind energy systems is deployed, for instance in relation to the decommissioning and removal of end-of-life offshore wind energy systems, the presence of dynamic cables suspended in the water column, the impact of submarine geohazards on the dynamic cables or the production of microplastics. Environmental monitoring data must be open source and be shared with the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the International Energy Agency Wind Energy Systems Technology Collaboration Programme’s (IEA Wind TCP) Task on the environmental effects of wind energy. read more Expected results Our knowledge on such impacts, positive and negative, is more advanced now than when the Offshore Strategy was adopted. However, there are still significant data and knowledge gaps. Most fieldwork studies have been carried out at very localised sites and often focused on specific species. These ad-hoc studies lead to conclusions that can hardly be generalised. A sound monitoring, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on ecosystems and their services, at wider scale and in interaction with other sea activities, is still largely missing. There is also a need to further develop models and other instruments for environmental risk assessment, identification of mitigation measures and recommendations for restoration measures, considering impacts during construction, operation and maintenance, repowering and decommissioning. Improving instruments, data, and knowledge on the cumulative environmental impacts of offshore energy, as well as a sound monitoring, is key to ensure that its expected fast and large-scale deployment will be sustainable. It will also better equip the EU to contribute to mitigate such impacts and promote sustainable deployment of offshore wind at regional (e.g., through OSPAR in the Northeast Atlantic) or subregional (e.g., through the Greater North Sea basin Initiative) level. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: The scientific community, public authorities, project designers, permitting authorities, civil society organisations and citizens have better tools (including Maritime Spatial Planning tools), reliable data and knowledge to monitor, assess and minimise the cumulative environmental, including on biodiversity, and socio-ecological impacts of large-scale bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy generation, including at sea-basin level and when combined with other planned or existing human activities; The monitoring of cumulative environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, of offshore wind installations is improved, with better tools and open data, in a coherent scheme with pre-existing monitoring programs of the marine environment at large scale; Ambitious national and regional offshore wind deployment targets are achieved with positive or minimum negative impacts on the marine and coastal environment; Deploy offshore wind energy with minimal impact on marine and coastal ecosystems, and, if possible, with net-positive ones. read more',

Construction and renovation works must also meet a variety of inter-related requirements such as structural and fire safety, acoustics, and a healthy and comfortable indoor environment. Call objectives Although much research has focused on developing materials and products with reduced whole life carbon emissions, the life cycle impacts of buildings depend on a complex interaction between individual products, components and technical building systems, spatial distribution, usage during their lifetime, and other design choices. There is therefore a need to deliver buildings and renovation works with minimal life cycle impacts, in particular global warming potential, based on circularity principles, also accommodating future building use-change through design for flexibility, and using innovative combinations of products and systems that result in optimal building-level performance.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description Demonstrate innovative large-scale production of liquid advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin for sectors with specific need for such fuels (particularly aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries). Production is expected to be based on various EU sustainable biomass feedstocks, notably biogenic residues and wastes, biogenic part of slurries and industrial wastes, and/or on non-biological origin feedstocks, such as renewable hydrogen and CO2 or renewable carbon, nitrogen, or their compounds, through chemical, biochemical, biological, and thermochemical pathways, or a combination of them. Call objectives Proposals are expected to: demonstrate large scale production of ready-to-deploy advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin, engaging feedstock developers and suppliers, technology developers, fuel suppliers, end users for purchasing the quantities, national bodies, and public or private authorities with funding capacity; address and assess the impact of actual, real-size feedstocks, (like for example agricultural wastes, energy crops grown on marginal and degraded lands or as intermediate crops, forestry wastes, biogenic municipal and industrial wastes, all types of renewable hydrogen, actual streams of CO2 and nitrogen, available renewable carbon or their compounds), in terms of their constitution on plant design, (e.g. for feedstock pretreatment and wastewater treatment as appropriate); address and assess the impact on plant design and feasibility of improving the feedstocks externally and upstream to the fuel production plant, by increasing the energy density of the feedstocks through for example torrefaction, by homogenisation of feedstocks for making them uniform or similar, and by standardisation of feedstocks, as appropriate. Projects should produce a lifetime cycle analysis of their production route and in particular for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, as inputs in terms of renewable energy and material (CO2, nitrogen, renewable hydrogen) may not be continuously available. Production of renewable hydrogen as an end-product is excluded from the scope of this topic. read more Expected effects and impacts The projects are expected to result in reference cases for ready-to-build, revamp/reuse and/or operate full-scale plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin. Improvements, optimisation, new schemes and modification of existing demonstration plants that can result into the preparation of the next full-scale plant are considered within scope to encourage deployment of cost-effective solutions. The plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong investment and business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment. It is expected to provide information and assessment about the economic viability of the commercial plant, the permitting procedures, a full value chain-based business plan and identified funding sources such as private equity, loans, loans guarantee, grants, or public financing for CAPEX and OPEX, as well as take-off agreements for the fuel uptake. Moreover, they should provide information on, or linked to, the identified funding sources, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU Catalyst Partnership, the Innovation Fund, and possibly the European Regional Development Fund programmes. Projects are expected to include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining local value and supply chains and the expected number of local jobs at the place of deployment. Furthermore, proposals are expected to provide information and assessment of impact on land and water use, soil and biodiversity, for example in relation to marginal and degraded land feedstocks, and of public awareness on full-scale renewable fuel plants. An assessment of the sustainability and the GHG reduction from fossil equivalents should be shown based on a life-cycle analysis for the large-scale fuel production. Special attention should be paid to estimating the GHG emissions reduction potential; projects are encouraged to use the methodology in the Innovation Fund. read more Expected results A quite wide portfolio of technologies, which are close to be deployed but still lack the real-world demonstration of economic viability, exists. Significant volumes of advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) are needed to cover the current fleets and the sectors where renewable fuels are the main long-term solution, such as aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries. Therefore, an exceptional effort is needed to establish more successful projects where full-scale plants are built and operated based on the vast potential of sustainable feedstocks throughout the EU. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Energy producers and consumers in transport and energy-intensive industries benefit from the mobilisation of building of industrial capacity for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin; Technology developers benefit from the support to the preparation of first-of-a-kind plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin to become precursors for the following commercial plants; Technology providers benefit from the de-risking of the innovative technologies, reduction of CAPEX and production costs, boosting of scale-up and contribution to market up-take of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin; Public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industrial stakeholders benefit from the improvement of the sustainability, reliability, robustness, and security of the relevant value chain; National authorities profit from the provided evidence for innovative advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin technologies, which can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive indicative target for innovative renewable energy technology in each Member State of at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, as well as to the targets under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime. Policy makers and regulators profit from the provided factual information and evidence in view of their decision as regards accelerating permitting procedures, harvesting benefits from multiple uses of land and water and increasing the responsiveness of research and innovation in that field to diverse societal interests and concerns; The implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action for Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated. read more',

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Energy producers and consumers in transport and energy-intensive industries benefit from the mobilisation of building of industrial capacity for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin; Technology developers benefit from the support to the preparation of first-of-a-kind plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin to become precursors for the following commercial plants; Technology providers benefit from the de-risking of the innovative technologies, reduction of CAPEX and production costs, boosting of scale-up and contribution to market up-take of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin; Public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industrial stakeholders benefit from the improvement of the sustainability, reliability, robustness, and security of the relevant value chain; National authorities profit from the provided evidence for innovative advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin technologies, which can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive indicative target for innovative renewable energy technology in each Member State of at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, as well as to the targets under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime. Policy makers and regulators profit from the provided factual information and evidence in view of their decision as regards accelerating permitting procedures, harvesting benefits from multiple uses of land and water and increasing the responsiveness of research and innovation in that field to diverse societal interests and concerns; The implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action for Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated. read more',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are one of the cheapest and fastest growing sources of electricity generation, largely thanks to an important decrease in the cost of solar modules in the last 10-15 years, and to their simple installation. Call objectives The degradation rate might vary depending on many factors such as material properties, environmental stress (solar irradiance, humidity, temperature, wind speed, dust, etc.), installation, design and type of components and connections, with some components deteriorating on their own and others impacting additional PV components, leading to more severe failures. To tackle these issues and extend the lifetime of PV modules (and systems) proposals are expected to: Identify defects and failure modes encountered in recently developed high-efficiency or novel design c-silicon modules themselves and their components, exploring their mechanisms and root causes, reviewing each component’s susceptibility to defects and failures and impacting additional PV components; Develop, where necessary, simple, cost-effective and accurate module defect detection techniques (including through Artificial Intelligence (AI)), applicable to most PV modules and systems; Propose mitigation approaches at module and system level and validate approaches through modelling and/or AI modelling and lab testing; Perform outdoor field experiments and testing to determine degradation rates and/or to identify defects and failure modes and estimate service lifetime. Different locations representing the European range of climates are to be considered for field experiments. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. read more Expected results The PV market is changing fast, recently transitioning to high-efficiency crystalline silicon cell concepts (e.g., Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon), Heterojunction (HJT), Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC), tandem, etc.), larger modules or novel designs (e.g., bifacial), use of new materials (e.g., anti-reflection and anti-soiling coatings, thinner glass, new encapsulants and backsheets), or increased number and topology of busbars or wires. There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. However, abnormal degradation rates are still reported for cell and module technologies due to a variety of failures which reduce reliability and increase the cost of PV systems operation. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Reduced degradation to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes; Increased module durability and reliability; Resource efficiency and lifelong energy yield improvement of PV systems; Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE); Execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. read more',

Depending on the capture routes chosen (e.g., solvents, sorbents, membranes, cryogenic, solid looping), examples of important issues to address include enhanced absorption/adsorption, improved kinetics and reduced energy use for CO2 capture and desorption, new materials with high selectivity for CO2 capture, flexibility of operation, modularisation and scale-up, space occupation, degradation and life span of capture materials, ability for retrofit, potential for heat integration, and solvent-induced corrosion. In particular for DAC, examples of important issues to address are novel sorbent or solvent materials that have higher CO2 capture capacities and longer-term stability in the presence of heat and air. For all proposals, minimisation of health and environmental impact must be addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up. The developed technologies should aim at delivering CO2 at the specifications required for transport and storage, with very low levels of impurities. For point-source capture, the technologies should address the performance profile and characteristic when operating under variable operating conditions such as load changes to maintain and as high as possible capture rate across the entire operating profile. Results from point-source capture should provide good matches between specific industrial application and capture technology while guaranteeing the quality and continuity of the industrial process. The use of the European Research Infrastructure for CO2 Capture, Utilisation, Transport and Storage ECCSEL is encouraged but not mandatory.

    'short description EU and associated countries continue to develop innovative building solutions that support the decarbonisation and climate resilience of buildings and the built environment, addressing energy performance, circularity, sustainability, resource efficiency, climate resilience, safety, durability and adaptability of the building stock, and whole life carbon emissions. Call objectives A key challenge remains the accelerated uptake of such solutions in building and renovation projects. Building value chain actors - such as housing association, municipal and regional authorities, or policy makers - require planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative building solutions and define pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of the building stock and the built environment under their responsibility. Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Develop and validate replicable and scalable planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative sets of building solutions when developing or regenerating (including deconstruction aspects when relevant) the building stock and the built environment; Validate the planning methods, procedures and sets of building solutions in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics.

    'short description EU and associated countries continue to develop innovative building solutions that support the decarbonisation and climate resilience of buildings and the built environment, addressing energy performance, circularity, sustainability, resource efficiency, climate resilience, safety, durability and adaptability of the building stock, and whole life carbon emissions. Call objectives A key challenge remains the accelerated uptake of such solutions in building and renovation projects. Building value chain actors - such as housing association, municipal and regional authorities, or policy makers - require planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative building solutions and define pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of the building stock and the built environment under their responsibility. Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Develop and validate replicable and scalable planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative sets of building solutions when developing or regenerating (including deconstruction aspects when relevant) the building stock and the built environment; Validate the planning methods, procedures and sets of building solutions in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics.

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'short description Metal halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention because of their low-cost fabrication and high efficiency. In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices. Dedicated manufacturing processes and equipment need also be demonstrated. Call objectives Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects: Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices; Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules; Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination; Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials; Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology. Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process. Proposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer. Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. read more Expected results The rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past decade makes it the most promising next generation photovoltaic technology, owing to its prominent advantages such as tuneable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, uncomplicated preparation process and considerable power conversion efficiency which has reached a certified 26.7% at cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base; Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components; Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. read more',

Call objectives Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects: Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices; Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules; Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination; Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials; Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology. Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process. Proposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer. Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. read more Expected results The rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past decade makes it the most promising next generation photovoltaic technology, owing to its prominent advantages such as tuneable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, uncomplicated preparation process and considerable power conversion efficiency which has reached a certified 26.7% at cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base; Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components; Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. read more',

Each action has specific objectives, supported activities, main target groups and terms and conditions. For more details, please consult the call document p. 11- 53. Action: Short supply chains The action contributes to the creation of short supply chains involving farmers, food producers, craftsmen and consumers with close geographical and social links and a shared commitment to local economic development in the cross-border region of Hungary and Slovakia. The proposed actions contribute to increasing opportunities and knowledge about short supply chains (SSC), especially with regard to today''s nutritional needs, food awareness and modern food production. The overall objectives of the Action are the followings: development of cross-border collaborations to improve the position of smallholder farmers and food producers in value chains increasing the retention of money in the local economy and agrotourism by supporting local producers and suppliers, services and local businesses producing more environmentally friendly products by reducing food miles and pollution building knowledge about the link between consumption and its impact on the environment through mindful consumption support pilot projects of SSC actors which represent a small-scale, time-limited trial designed to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact of a concept, product, or service before full-scale implementation. Action: Social innovations for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups The proposed action aims to improve the employability of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, facilitate their integration into the labour market, create quality and sustainable jobs and forms of employment, and combat poverty and social exclusion. Disadvantaged and vulnerable groups include persons excluded from the labour market, coming from segregated or marginalised communities and face various difficulties when entering the labour market (qualification, professional or personal deficits, regional disadvantages). Social innovations should improve the employability, reduce unemployment and underemployment, strengthen labour market participation and integration, social inclusion and the quality of life of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. Due to the complexity of the unmet needs of the target groups, complex projects should be developed, involving several complementary activities tailored to the needs of the target groups. The action supports the joint development or adaptation of social innovations that representing new methods and approaches to address unmet social needs based on new knowledge, experience and expertise. The program promotes cross-border cooperation and partnerships involving multiple stakeholders, enabling joint innovation (development of new methods, networks, services, and cooperation) and joint implementation of pilot projects which are small-scale, time-limited trials designed to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact of a concept, product, or service before full-scale implementation. Action: Inclusive and quality education The action aims to promote cross-border co-operation in building inclusive and high-performing education systems for educational communities with the presence of disadvantaged learners, aiming to foster their inclusion and equal participation. Disadvantaged learners include students from low-income families, coming from segregated or marginalised communities and students with learning, behavioural or developmental difficulties and disabilities. The action aims to improve educational outcomes and ensure equitable access to meaningful education and reduce the number of early school dropout. Integrated development – linking infrastructure investments with pedagogical innovation – is at the centre of this approach, as is the strengthening of teachers'' skills and the use of digital and AI-powered educational tools. The programme promotes cross-border cooperation and multi-stakeholder partnerships that enable mutual learning in particular local adaptation of best practises, knowledge exchange, joint innovation and the joint implementation of pilot projects aimed at sustainable change in formal and non-formal education institutions. Action: Family and community-based health care services The aim of the action is to improve access to healthcare, health literacy and thus the health status of thepopulation living in the programme area by supporting communities and families with activities, services and equipment that can be used by the population on both sides of the border. The action promotes family-based healthcare characterised by: holistic care for all family members across all ages prevention and early intervention such as immunisation maternal and child health services health education tailored to the family unit and support in managing chronic diseases in the home environment. The action also promotes community-based health services provided locally by health centres, outreach clinics or mobile health units. These include: involvement of community health workers or volunteers trained in primary health care public health programmes such as vaccination campaigns, sanitation and vector control health promotion activities such as awareness campaigns, screening and nutrition programmes and focus on equity and aim to reach underserved and vulnerable populations. Both countries are struggling with a shortage of general practitioners and doctors in outpatient sector. The ageing of the medical population, especially of general practitioners, is a serious challenge for the healthcare system. It is therefore important to support young doctors entering general practise and ensure that the system allows them a smooth transition into the world of work. The action supports the introduction of new technologies and approaches that improve the accessibility, efficiency and quality of healthcare in the general practitioner’s sector. The most important of these include digital transformation, personalised medicine, integrated care, prevention and education. Action: Cross-border development of healthcare institutions The action facilitates border crossings, that will promote the mobility of patients and healthcare professionals and improve access to quality healthcare services in the border area. In many cases there are parallel capacities and at the same time a lack of medical care on both sides of the border. The main aim of the actions is to further develop the healthcare facilities in the border region through a more efficient use of spatial, instrumental, electronic and innovative solutions in the provision of healthcare services and to use these improvements to provide services that can also be used for the population from the other side of the border. The aim of the action is to modernise healthcare facilities in the border area based on the real need and the potential cross-border mobility of patients, the lack of and parallel capacities and services of healthcare facilities in order to create truly cross-border healthcare services. read more',

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly.',

    'short description The aim of this call for proposals is to support transnational research and/or innovation projects that help cities tackle urban challenges and transition towards a climate neutral and resilient future for all. Projects should contribute to one or more of our three thematic areas, the Transition Pathways: 15-minute City, Circular Urban Economies and Positive Energy Districts. Call objectives The 15-minute City Transition Pathway (15mC TP) addresses challenges of urban mobility, logistics, public space and proximity-based policies to promote implementation of climate neutral, resilient neighbourhoods for all. It draws on research and innovation projects to showcase a diverse mosaic of approaches that drive mobility transitions. The 15mC TP aims to enable analysis, development and testing of ideas, tools and innovations for 15-minute cities within co-creative and transdisciplinary settings. The Circular Urban Economies Transition Pathway (CUE TP) aims to foster urban places, communities and neighbourhoods that are sustained by circular resource flows and enhance the wellbeing of their inhabitants and ecosystems. It encourages urban planning and design characterised by regenerative urbanism, favouring the combination of circular principles, urban greening, and equal access to urban spaces and resources. The Positive Energy Districts Transition Pathway (PED TP) aims to develop innovative solutions for planning, large-scale implementation, and replication of PEDs across Europe’s urban and peri-urban areas. By combining energy efficiency, renewable energy production, and energy flexibility at the local level, PEDs offer and contribute to affordable energy systems, affordable quality housing, and competitive, resilient and inclusive local economies for cities through energy communities, contributing to European goals such as the SET Plan and the EU Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities. read more Expected results The basis for the Call topics descriptions are the three Transition Pathways (TP): 15-minute City, Positive Energy Districts and Circular Urban Economies. For each TP, three topics are defined as focus areas for this year’s Call. Since urban transition issues are intrinsically interconnected, a proposal may address several topics, from one or more TP. Whilst, crosscutting projects, which combine topics from more than one TP, are encouraged, each project must choose one TP topic that is closest to their subject as a guide. The proposal will be evaluated on the criteria of its main TP. Crosscutting characteristics will be considered in the assessment. 15-minute City Transition Pathway (15mC TP) - more information on pages 13-18 of the call document The 15mC TP topics in this call emphasise the “Shift” and “Avoid” strategies of mobility policy. They invite proposals to drive governance and social innovations, apply technology and develop business models to advance evidence, tools and policies for inclusive, sustainable and resilient urban mobility. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary projects are particularly encouraged, aiming to engage diverse stakeholders and co-creation approaches for a just transition. Over the years, the 15mC TP aims to develop a portfolio of innovations, tools and approaches. These will result from DUT-funded projects, tested in local case studies and living labs and ultimately serve as practical models showcasing feasible ways to promote urban mobility transitions. The 15mC topics in Call 2025 are: Next steps for multimodal urban mobility, building on travel experience Reimagining parking – transforming urban parking policies Mobility policymaking in context of radical contestation Circular Urban Economies Transition Pathway (CUE TP) - more information on pages 18-23 of the call document The CUE TP aims to foster urban places, communities and neighbourhoods that are sustained by circular resource flows and enhance the wellbeing of their inhabitants and ecosystems. It encourages urban planning and design characterised by regenerative urbanism, favouring the combination of circular principles, urban greening, and equal access to urban spaces and resources. The CUE topics in DUT Call 2025 are focused around: Resilience aspects of combining green and social infrastructure, Circular benefits and challenges for sustainable tourism, and Public procurement to foster urban greening and circularity. Positive Energy Districts Transition Pathway (PED TP) - more information on pages 23-30 of the call document The PED TP aims at supporting the planning, implementation and replication of PEDs throughout Europe. As a concept, the PED concept supports the vision of future urban energy systems, by both optimising energy efficiency and facilitating the generation of renewable energy, from the scale of city districts down to individual buildings. Moreover, urban districts following the PED approach will be able to support the regional or national energy system through the smoothing of energy production peaks, management of demand and facilitating the exchange and storage of energy. Beyond these technical characteristics, PEDs enable the combination of energy efficient buildings and their associated district grids with architectural and social innovation. Public involvement in its design plays a key role in the successful realisation of a PED, with public administrations, real estate developers, utilities and the public at large, functioning as supporting pillars. Through their combined efforts, these actors enable a PED to raise the quality of life in the city, contribute to the Paris Agreement targets and enhance cooperation between stakeholders in any urban governance system. At the core, we define PEDs as follows (PED Framework Definition): Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) are energy-efficient and energy-flexible urban areas that produce local renewable energy, achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions and play an active role in the energy system for achieving overall climate neutrality. The PED topics of DUT Call 2025 focus on the linking PED solutions in wider context to support mainstreaming and scaling of the concept in a multi-level perspective. A strong focus is on exploring innovative solutions in light of their socio-economic impact and providing evidence for social and socio-economic benefits of PED development. The PED topics in DUT Call 2025 are: Driving a just transition: PED strategies in social and subsidised housing Ensuring positive socio-economic impact: PEDs in local economies and energy markets PEDs in urban heating and cooling strategies For topics with a stronger technological focus, the Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CET Partnership) Call 2025 is recommended. read more',

Through their combined efforts, these actors enable a PED to raise the quality of life in the city, contribute to the Paris Agreement targets and enhance cooperation between stakeholders in any urban governance system. At the core, we define PEDs as follows (PED Framework Definition): Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) are energy-efficient and energy-flexible urban areas that produce local renewable energy, achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions and play an active role in the energy system for achieving overall climate neutrality. The PED topics of DUT Call 2025 focus on the linking PED solutions in wider context to support mainstreaming and scaling of the concept in a multi-level perspective. A strong focus is on exploring innovative solutions in light of their socio-economic impact and providing evidence for social and socio-economic benefits of PED development. The PED topics in DUT Call 2025 are: Driving a just transition: PED strategies in social and subsidised housing Ensuring positive socio-economic impact: PEDs in local economies and energy markets PEDs in urban heating and cooling strategies For topics with a stronger technological focus, the Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CET Partnership) Call 2025 is recommended. read more',

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipApplicants can be: research organisations (higher education institutions including universities, university colleges; research institutes or other entities with research undertakings), companies and commercial organisations, urban government authorities (such as regional and local government institutions, municipalities and municipal organisations, city authorities, urban public administrations, and infrastructure and service providers), consumers and civil society representatives (e.g. local and community organisations, non-governmental organisations, not-for-profit organisations, citizens’ representatives, etc.). From the culture and creative sectors (e.g. artists and designers) Eligibility rules for the consortia and Applicants: Transnational eligibility rule 1: Each proposal must be submitted by a consortium consisting of at least three eligible Applicants from at least three different participating countries (see Annex A). Only Applicants eligible for funding by the participating Funding Agencies from the following countries are eligible to apply as Main Applicant or Co-applicant: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Tunisia and Türkiye. In addition, at least two of the eligible Applicants must be from different EU Member States (MS) or Associated Countries (AC) to the Horizon Europe eligible for EC co-funding in this Call: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and Türkiye. All legal entities must be independent from each other to be considered as different applicants. Please pay careful attention to the specific Funding Agencies’ rules regarding eligibility of applicants in Annex A since not all Funding Agencies can support all types of Applicants. Ineligible Applicants (e.g. from other countries or ineligible to receive funding from a participating Funding Agency) may participate as a Cooperation Partner. Transnational eligibility rule 2: The Main Applicant (project coordinator) must be eligible to be funded and request funding by its national/regional participating Funding Agency. Transnational eligibility rule 3: A Principal Investigator (PI) must only participate in a maximum of two proposals, and only once as the PI of a Main Applicant. If the DUT Call Secretariat, in charge of checking transnational eligibility, identifies the same person as PI in more than two pre-proposals, or as PI of the Main Applicant of more than one pre-proposal, all pre-proposals/full proposals in which they are a PI, will be declared ineligible. Transnational eligibility rule 4: Consortia must include at least one urban governmentauthority (city, municipality or entity providing key urban services, so long as this entity is owned by a local government (confirmation of this by the local government may be requested by the Call Secretariat)) either as a Main Applicant, Co-applicant, or Cooperation Partner depending on the national/regional eligibility criteria. other eligibility criteriaRecommendations for the consortia composition Consortia may include partners active across several positions within the research and development system (i.e., innovation, applied research, strategic/fundamental research) and across disciplines (natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities, engineering, etc.). Moreover, consortia should include preferably at least one representative from companies and commercial organisations, consumers or civil society, either as a Main Applicant, Co-applicant, or Cooperation Partner, depending on the national/regional eligibility criteria. Typically, small to medium sized consortia (involving funding requests to 3-5 Funding Agencies on average per proposal), are expected. However, there is no upper limit, and consortia may involve as many partners as necessary for a convincing proposal, ensuring that all participants have a justified role. Each partner within the consortium should clearly add value to the objectives of the proposed project. Depending on the nature of the project, each partner in the consortium must demonstrate how they will exploit the expected results. Consortia are expected to be balanced between countries, both in terms of number of partners and distribution of budget and no individual Applicant or Cooperation Partner may represent more than 50% of the workload calculated in terms of person-months. Consortia must integrate gender balance and other diversity aspects in the dedicated section of the proposal (see the Evaluation Criteria in section 4.5). It is also possible to include “widening” countries, as long as they are participating in the Call (see Annex A for a list of participating Funding Agencies). Please note that all consortium partners should serve a purpose that enhances the proposal; therefore, it is only recommended to add a widening partner (or any partner, for that matter) if their tasks provide a clear benefit to the success of the project. Also, Applicants should take into account the budgets and expected number of projects of all involved Funding Agencies (listed in Annex A of this document) when building the project consortium. A Funding Agency that receives to many applications will likely encounter budget issues, which may lead to most of those Applicants being eliminated due to financial constraints. Funding recommendations There are no fixed minimum or maximum limits for a project size. Medium sized projects with a total budget request from all involved Funding Agencies in the range of EUR 1-2 M are typically expected, though total project costs can be lower or higher. However, funding limits exist for many Funding Agencies. Annex A indicates the budget available from each Funding Agency and corresponding funding rules and limitations (namely maximum amount per project or per Applicant, or a range of funding demands expected from one proposal). In the proposal, a justification of the requested budget is required. The estimated budget must be given in euros only and be tabulated according to the proposal template provided. All costs must be eligible according to the Funding Agencies’ rules (see Annex A). In case of doubt, Applicants should consult their respective Funding Agencies.',

Proposals written in other languages will be ineligible. The proposal form should be filled in completely. Pre-proposals and full proposals must respect the total number of pages using a standard font size and normal page margins as indicated on the proposal form. Pre-proposals and full proposals must be submitted on the UEFISCDI electronic submission system, UDiManager (www.uefiscdi-direct.ro), before each associated deadline: the Call for pre-proposals is open until 17 November 2025, 13:00 (CET). In March 2025, applicants will be invited to enter the second stage of the procedure: the Call for full proposals will close on 23 April 2026, 13:00 (CEST). An online help document with guidelines for submission will be provided, detailing the procedures and duties of the Main Applicant and of other consortium partners. It is not possible to resubmit or revise the pre-proposal/full proposal after the submission deadline, unless it pertains to corrections to technical administrative details and is requested by the Call Secretariat. Only pre-proposals invited to submit a full proposal will be eligible in the second stage of the selection procedure. If a Main Applicant decides to submit a full proposal rejected at the end of the first stage, this full proposal will be declared ineligible. No fundamental changes initiated by the applicants alone between the pre-proposal and the full proposal will be accepted. Namely: the project objectives stated in the pre-proposal cannot be changed, the Main Applicant (and its PI) must stay the same, except in case of force majeure, the consortium (co-applicants) should stay the same (with the exception of the Inclusion possibilities allowed explicitly by the Call Secretariat, see call document section 4.1), only minor changes on the funding demand per Funding Agency can be allowed (except in the case adding Inclusion Procedure partners). changes in the consortium structure requested as part of the Fallback Procedure (see section 3.7 of the call document) are considered modifications requested by the Call Secretariat and are therefore exempt from this rule. The Call Secretariat may allow such modifications in exceptional cases, if duly justified. Modifications requested by a Funding Agency do not count as changes between the pre-proposal and the full proposal stages. By submitting a pre-proposal/full proposal, applicants agree that it will be forwarded to all Funding Agencies, which are receiving a request to provide funding for that proposal. Some Funding Agencies require submission of information on a national/regional level as well (see Annex A). Call documents DUT 2025 Call textDUT 2025 Call text(3629kB) Contact DUT Website',

    'short description The objective of this call is to foster the awareness and resilience of young Europeans related to information integrity risks, strengthening relevant media and digital literacy skills. This to equip them with the skills and knowledge to navigate safely and critically in the online information space and participate in society as active and informed citizens. This should be achieved by developing engaging, multilingual content tailored to the consumption patterns and interests of young Europeans. Ensuring a broad coverage of at least thirteen EU Member States is a key criterion for the proposal evaluation. Call objectives The call seeks to fund two innovative projects that implement the following activities in all covered Member States. 1. Design a participatory process involving young Europeans and influencers The consortium will design and implement a participatory process to allow young Europeans to share their ideas, questions and concerns related to the online information space and information integrity, involving them in the creation and dissemination of engaging content to address information integrity and safety online. The objective is to ensure strong involvement of young Europeans as well as influencers at all stages, from design to delivery. This aims to ensure that the multimedia content, and the campaigns designed to disseminate it, are as targeted and relevant as possible to young Europeans’ interests while also leveraging on the experience, knowledge and follower base of influencers. 2. Produce youth-oriented content related to the threats to information integrity and ways to counter them The consortium will produce engaging multilingual multimedia content that caters to the needs and preferences and consumption habits of 15- to 30-year-olds across all covered Member States. 3. Develop a wide, cross-national and inclusive media literacy campaign The consortium will design and implement a comprehensive digital media campaign that will ensure an EU-wide and as broad as possible dissemination of the multimedia content produced under point 2. The campaign will also serve to maintain an overview of all activities related to the project and to collect relevant metrics on reach and impact (audiences reached via the different channels used, number and quality of interactions with the campaign content, etc.). The campaign’s key messages will support the objective of this Call for proposals, which is to promote critical thinking and responsible online behaviour among young Europeans aged 15–30 by helping them identify, understand and counter the mechanisms that threaten information integrity. 4. Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and standards on information integrity The consortium will apply ethical guidelines and standards on information integrity in their partnerships with influencers and in the whole process for producing and disseminating multimedia content. This will ensure that the output is accurate, trustworthy, ethical, and privacy-respecting. read more Expected effects and impacts The projects are expected to have the following impacts: Increased awareness about risks related to information integrity and boosting media literacy skills through high-quality, influencer- and youth-led content: By producing compelling, multilingual content fronted by trusted and relatable creators, projects will measurably boost young Europeans’ ability to recognise, analyse and counter information integrity risks including misleading information—evidenced by clear reach, engagement and learning metrics across at least thirteen Member States. New and lasting cross-sector, cross-border collaborations: The creation of new partnerships between influencers, information integrity professionals including fact-checkers, media literacy professionals and/or civil society organisations will allow each community to enrich its expertise with new insights, while expanding its geographical reach. Importantly, the consortium should aim to create a community that has a lasting impact beyond the duration of the project. To this extent, the funded projects, once awarded, shall establish contact with each other and seek active exchange. Heighten standards of information integrity, especially among the community of influencers: The involvement of influencers and young Europeans in a campaign raising awareness about risks related to information integrity and good practices to counter them is expected to raise related standards both within the community involved in content creation, and beyond. Positive social and well-being outcomes: Greater awareness of manipulative online content among young Europeans will also contribute to mitigate certain mental health pressures, curb polarisation and encourage socially responsible behaviour online, contributing to a more resilient European digital sphere. Sustainable knowledge-sharing: The project will leave a legacy by codifying successful content, formats, and dissemination methods through an evaluation system with relevant metrics. read more Expected results To involve young Europeans and influencers in a participatory process to create engaging content on the risks threatening information integrity. The content should include ways to identify, understand and counter such threats while promoting critical thinking among young Europeans aged 15–30. To disseminate content across all at least thirteen EU Member States through a media literacy campaign that leverages creative storytelling by mobilising influencers, who will work in full editorial independence, supported by digital media and artificial intelligence. To foster new collaborations between information integrity professionals (e.g. fact-checkers, media literacy practitioners, civil society organisations) and influencers, so that they can join forces and learn from each other on ways to promote media literacy and critical thinking among young Europeans. Such collaborations should also aim to support the creation of a virtual community allowing influencers to easily connect with fact-checkers, media literacy practitioners and other information integrity professionals across Europe. To collect and share lessons learned on how influencers can integrate information integrity best practices in their work, including by raising the trustworthiness of their own content. This should involve an evaluation of the reach, impact and effectiveness of the conducted campaigns by the consortium partners. read more',

    'short description The initiative is structured around two complementary and mutually reinforcing objectives. Together, they aim to lay the foundations for a European model of AI-enabled cardiovascular and comorbid chronic disease care, grounded in high-quality health data and real-world validated solutions. Call objectives This initiative aims to leverage AI and health data to accelerate the early detection, prediction, personalised prevention, integrated management and rehabilitation of CVDs and related NCDs, including rare and complex forms. Objective 1 — Leveraging Health Data for AI Applications in Cardiovascular and Related Chronic Diseases The first objective is to structure, federate, and enable access to high-quality health data across the Union to support the development, training, validation, and deployment of AI tools focused on cardiovascular diseases and related non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and obesity). This will align with and prepare for the future application the EHDS, which provides the regulatory and technical framework to enable the secure, privacy preserving, and interoperable secondary use of health data across Member States. Objective 2 — Deploying AI Solutions for Risk Prediction, Prevention, Treatments, and Personalised Care The second objective is to identify, validate, and scale up mature AI applications capable of improving the risk prediction, early detection, personalised prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of cardiovascular and related chronic diseases. read more Expected effects and impacts Improved health outcomes: Earlier diagnosis and more targeted prevention of NCDs, leading to reduced disease progression, complications, and avoidable mortality. Greater equity: Enhanced access to personalised diagnostics and AI-supported care pathways, especially in underserved regions or Member States with limited innovation capacity. Efficiency and sustainability of health systems: Better use of resources through predictive and preventive approaches, reducing the burden of chronic conditions on healthcare infrastructures. Trust in European health AI: By ensuring compliance with data protection, safety, and transparency standards, the initiative will foster trust in the responsible use of AI for health in line with the AI Act and EHDS Regulation. It will also support the uptake — and where relevant, the development — of specifications and standards foreseen under both frameworks, notably for interoperability, risk management and data governance read more Expected results This initiative is expected to generate tangible, scalable results supporting the adoption of AIdriven personalised care for cardiovascular diseases and related non-communicable conditions, while laying the foundations of a trusted European data ecosystem for health innovation. Expected results – Data dimension Creation of a large-scale, federated, high-quality dataset for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, aligned with the EHDS framework. This dataset will be representative, inclusive, and interoperable, and will enable the development, training and benchmarking of AI tools across borders. Definition and uptake of minimum technical specifications for cardiovascular datasets, including structured phenotypes, genetic and biometric markers, and metadata quality labelling. Expected results – AI adoption dimension Validated AI solutions: A portfolio of AI tools will be piloted in real-world clinical settings, with demonstrated effectiveness in early detection, risk prediction, and personalised prevention of cardiovascular and related chronic diseases. Deployment frameworks: The initiative will produce practical guidelines and protocols to facilitate the integration and scale-up of AI applications across diverse healthcare systems. These will cover governance, interoperability, clinician training, patient engagement, and continuous performance monitoring. Strategic guidance: The publication of a roadmap and a blueprint for large-scale integration will inform health authorities, hospitals, and policymakers on how to responsibly and sustainably adopt AI tools, supporting informed decisions at national and Union levels. Robust evidence base: The project will generate comparative data on safety, performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness), usability and acceptability, informing both clinical practice and health policy. read more',

Expected results – Data dimension Creation of a large-scale, federated, high-quality dataset for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, aligned with the EHDS framework. This dataset will be representative, inclusive, and interoperable, and will enable the development, training and benchmarking of AI tools across borders. Definition and uptake of minimum technical specifications for cardiovascular datasets, including structured phenotypes, genetic and biometric markers, and metadata quality labelling. Expected results – AI adoption dimension Validated AI solutions: A portfolio of AI tools will be piloted in real-world clinical settings, with demonstrated effectiveness in early detection, risk prediction, and personalised prevention of cardiovascular and related chronic diseases. Deployment frameworks: The initiative will produce practical guidelines and protocols to facilitate the integration and scale-up of AI applications across diverse healthcare systems. These will cover governance, interoperability, clinician training, patient engagement, and continuous performance monitoring. Strategic guidance: The publication of a roadmap and a blueprint for large-scale integration will inform health authorities, hospitals, and policymakers on how to responsibly and sustainably adopt AI tools, supporting informed decisions at national and Union levels. Robust evidence base: The project will generate comparative data on safety, performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness), usability and acceptability, informing both clinical practice and health policy. read more',

    'short description The Interreg Deutschland-Danmark program promotes cross-border cooperation between Germany and Denmark and supports the growth of the region in the areas of business, employment, education, tourism and culture by funding innovative cross-border projects that aim to bring about positive change in German-Danish cooperation. No further applications can be submitted for Priority 3 "An attractive region". The priority is closed and the funds have been exhausted. Call objectives The following priorities and specific objectives were developed as part of the program: P1: An innovative region SO 1.1: Development and expansion of research and innovation capacities and the introduction of advanced technologies P2: A green region SO 2.1: Development of smart energy systems, grids and storage systems outside the trans-European energy network (TEN-E) SO 2.2: Promoting climate change adaptation and disaster prevention and resilience, taking into account ecosystem-based approaches SO 2.3: Promoting the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy P4: A functional region SO 4.1: Improving the efficiency of public administration bodies by promoting their legal and administrative cooperation and cooperation between citizens on the one hand and institutions on the other, with the aim of removing legal and other barriers in border regions SO 4.2: Creating mutual trust, especially through incentives for people-to-people activities You can find an overview of the specific measures and the extent to which they have already been fulfilled or not fulfilled here in the traffic light overview. This should give you a good overview of the areas in which it may be particularly worthwhile to develop an application. read more Expected results The following measures are proposed in the program (non-exhaustive list): P1: An innovative region - A detailed list of eligible measures can be found here. SO 1.1: Development and expansion of research and innovation capacities and the introduction of advanced technologies The specific objective aims to make further contributions to strengthening R&D activities, growth and even better use of research results in the program region through targeted innovations. Furthermore, the competencies and strengths as well as the (existing) innovation and research capacities are to be used increasingly across borders and thus more efficiently and synergies are to be developed. The concept of innovation is understood broadly: it can involve product and process innovations as well as social innovations. An application-oriented approach (with the involvement of companies) is important here - especially for research activities; basic research is not funded in the Interreg program. Thematically, the priority is also largely open, although there is a particular focus on the common strength positions of the program area: Maritime economy Life science and welfare technologies Food industry Digital economy Robotics and automation The only exceptions are the topics of energy, climate change and circular economy, as these - including the respective innovation, development and implementation process - are covered in the priority "A green region". P2: A green region - A detailed list of eligible measures can be found here. SO 2.1: Development of smart energy systems, grids and storage systems outside the trans-European energy network (TEN-E) This specific objective supports projects that contribute to the development and establishment of intelligent energy systems, grids and storage systems in order to ensure a stable energy supply in the program region in the future. A pioneering role in the field of renewable energies has already been developed in the German-Danish program region. The program partners pursue similar objectives with regard to reducing CO2 emissions and the use of fossil fuels, and there is a common interest in promoting renewable energies. Fossil fuels are to be increasingly replaced by renewable energies not only in the electricity sector, but also in the heating, cooling and transport sectors. In addition, the German-Danish region has developed a leading international role in the field of power electronics in recent years. This must be maintained and expanded. SO 2.2: Promoting adaptation to climate change and disaster prevention and resilience, taking into account ecosystem-based approaches Within this specific objective, joint cross-border and needs-oriented solutions for the challenges of climate change are to be developed at and for the regional and municipal level in order to develop the German-Danish region into a climate-resilient region. To this end, specific regional needs and barriers to adaptation to climate change are to be jointly identified, solutions developed and recommendations for policy-makers and regional and local administrations derived. This also includes raising political awareness of this issue and measures to provide citizens with well-founded information about climate change and its effects on the program region. However, the overall approach of the program can only be to promote "soft" cooperation, which can nevertheless serve as preparatory measures for investment and infrastructure projects. SO 2.3: Promoting the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy Although the program region is a technologically highly developed area compared to other European regions, economic production with regard to waste prevention is not yet satisfactory and does not provide a sufficient starting point for a green transition. Therefore, there is a need in cross-border cooperation to find new joint solutions, both within the individual value chains and at a higher level, i.e. in planning and within the system. In this specific objective, cross-border solutions as well as models and demonstrations are therefore to be developed in order to design planning and product design in such a way that materials and resources can be kept in the cycle for as long as possible, or to identify materials and resources to prevent waste production from the outset. All solutions should have a positive impact on value creation and competitiveness and reduce waste volumes in the long term. The program''s approach includes all economic sectors. P4: A functional region - A detailed list of eligible measures can be found here. SO 4.1: Improving the efficiency of public administration bodies by promoting their cooperation in the fields of law and administration and cooperation between citizens on the one hand and institutions on the other, with the aim of removing legal and other obstacles in border regions Cross-border cooperation in the programme region is characterized by a large number of stakeholders who cooperate with each other at different levels, in different thematic areas and at different levels. However, the further anchoring of many well-established cooperations could still be significantly improved, for example through corresponding commitment and implementation in the institutions'' own strategies as well as the provision of resources. Overall, cooperation in some areas is not yet sufficiently developed and great potential for cross-border added value remains untapped. In addition, there are further obstacles to closer cooperation, particularly at a legal or administrative level, which influence or even prevent cooperation. In this specific objective, established topics are therefore to be further developed and new topics identified in order to extend strategic German-Danish cooperation to other topics that are distinct from the pure implementation of the Interreg program. These topics also include the (further) development of a joint labor market. SO 4.2: Creating mutual trust, especially through incentives for people-to-people activities An important framework condition for cross-border cooperation and cohesion in the German-Danish area is mutual trust as well as understanding and recognition of each other''s culture, language, values and attitudes. Trust between citizens on both sides of the border can only grow through concrete experiences. Therefore, this specific objective should contribute to strengthening mutual trust between the citizens of the program region. This must be achieved in particular through initiatives that promote international understanding and strengthen intercultural understanding among citizens. This means, among other things, that citizens'' knowledge of German and Danish lifestyles, culture and shared history is expanded across the border. This also includes improving the conditions for learning Danish and German. The expectation is that citizen encounters will create an ever greater public awareness of the importance of intercultural differences and their potential to make the program region special. read more',

    'short description The Danube Region Programme (DRP) is launching the 3rd Call for Proposals (CfP). The programme offers financial support to transnational projects contributing to the development of a more innovative, sustainable and more social Danube Region. The programme has been designed under the territorial cooperation goal of the European Union. The uniqueness of the programme consists of offering a platform for cooperation in strategic areas between EU Member States and non-EU Partner States in the Danube region. In this CfP, applicants can submit proposals under the following Specific Objectives: SO1.2, SO2.1, SO2.2, SO2.3, SO3.1. SO3.2 and SO4.2. Furthermore, this CfP is a targeted call. It means that only proposals addressing the thematic focuses defined in the Call announcement can be funded by the Programme. Call objectives Specific Objective 1.2 - Development of skills for advancing smart specialisation strategies, industrial transformation and transition towards industry 4.0, including cross-sectorial collaborations 3rd call thematic focus: AI skills development for delivering products and services with transnational impact in the Danube Region Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and redefining how businesses operate globally. In the Danube Region, there is an urgent need to equip organisations with AI-related skills to enhance competitiveness, drive innovation, and ensure sustainable economic growth. This 3rd call thematic scope is also strongly linked to the EC COM (2025) 163 A modernised Cohesion policy: The mid-term review stating that “digitalisation of public services and the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the public and private sectors are levers for competitiveness. This 3rd CfP is targeting projects that foster AI skills development, enabling primarily public and private non-profit organisations supporting businesses, start-ups, and professionals to leverage AI technologies for transnational collaboration, digital transformation, and creation of high-value products and services. Specific Objective 2.1 - Support greening the energy and transport sectors in the Danube Region by enhancing the integration of renewable energy sources 3rd call thematic focus: Considering the provisions outlined in the “Energy transition” section of “A modernised Cohesion policy: The mid-term review” (MTR, COM(2025) 163 final) published by the European Commission and taking into account the still growing need for sustainable, renewable energy solutions in line with the IP of the Interreg Danube Region highlights the necessity to define a targeted 3rd call for “sustainable renewable energy solutions in the context of energy production, heating and cooling systems, grid load, energy communities, district heating and cooling, storage and peak load reduction” directly linked to focus 1 of SO2.1 “Increasing the share of renewable energy in the Danube region”. Specific Objective 2.2 - Promoting climate change adaptation capacities in the Danube Region and disaster management on transnational level in relation to environmental risks taking into account ecosystem-based approaches 3rd call thematic focus: The proposed applications can address the three thematic focuses of SO 2.2, but should target broader territorial scope beyond the urban, municipal level, where transnational level harmonisation and coordination of forecasting, monitoring, preparedness, or reaction is necessary (targeting the Danube River Basin, or its main sub-basins, or the Danube Region, a thematically reasonable, broad and coherent transnational space within, covering the targeted area in its entirety – e.g. a transnational river network, a broad transnational area of DR affected by the same environmental risk with potential transboundary impact) in connection to climate change adaptation and / or climate change induced environmental risks (floods, droughts, wild fires),or accidental pollution of rivers. Specific Objective 2.3 - Sustainable, integrated, transnational water and sediment management in the Danube River Basin ensuring good quality and quantity of waters and sediment balance 3rd call thematic focus: Proposals can address thematic focus 2 (harmonising management practices between relevant sectors to improve the quality and quantity of transnational water bodies) and thematic focus 3 (transnational coordination of water supply management in transnational river(basin)s) of SO2.3. More specifically, the proposed applications should target potential impacts of climate change on transnational water management by harmonising and coordinating policy approaches, management practises between water management, agriculture, environment, navigation and hydropower to improve the quantity (and quality) of water in transnational river systems of DRB with key topics in relation to water scarcity, balanced use of water and coordinated management of low-water periods on transnational rivers of DRB (considering also that flood management is related to SO 2.2). This thematic scope is also in strong connection with the COM/2025/0084 regulation proposal, which aligns cohesion policy investments to the new challenges and priorities identified by the mid-term review of the Cohesion Policy, among others adding water resilience to the scope of water management. The geographic scope of the proposals shall be on the whole Danube River Basin, or at least a sufficiently broad part of it, major transnational river(s), river basin and possibly in the entirety of the targeted river basin. Specific Objective 3.1 - Accessible, inclusive and effective labour markets 3rd call thematic focus: Capacity building for employment support bodies (information and data systems; coordination; training e.g. in social economy). The context in which employment services are operating in the Danube Region is characterised by rapid change, driven in large part by demographic shifts, migration, digital transformation and the green transition. Consequently, new forms of employment, skills, social attitudes and career paths are needed in the DR to support our labour markets and society more widely. Our aim is to build the capacity of employment services to respond to the challenges and prepare services in support of effective, agile, inclusive and resilient labour markets. This could include new or improved information and data systems; coordinating structures and processes between services and supporting stakeholders; developing service capacity through innovative training methodologies - for example in social economy, AI, skills assessment, inclusion, etc. Indicative examples from one of the DR challenges, of the type of approaches that could fit within the scope of this specific objective can be seen below. Specific Objective 3.2 - Accessible and inclusive quality services in education, training and lifelong learning 3rd call thematic focus 1: To strengthen Danube Region strategic approaches in support of Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs) in the Danube Region. A Danube Region strategic support approach for CoVEs should build on the work of the existing EUSDR Danube Region Platform on Centres of Vocational Excellence/Policy Platform for CoVEs started in 2021 Danube Region Platform on Centres of Vocational Excellence - EUSDR - Danube Strategy Point. A Danube Region project(s) could complement and further develop this initiative with a more coordinating/operational approach, which could include: Pilot programmes of work with a transnational character on specific areas of work, e.g. internationalization of CoVEs, CoVEs and social inclusion, public private partnerships; CoVEs and smart specialization; lifelong learning Creating networks, forums and working groups on specific themes connecting VET policy makers and providers with companies and industry representatives across the Danube Region Developing a support function for the understanding, guidance and complementarity of different programmes in the Danube Region supporting CoVEs (national, regional, transnational) Awareness and capacity building programmes for CoVEs in the Danube Region Strategic CoVE development in fields of transnational interest across the Danube Region 3rd call thematic focus 2: The development of existing CoVEs or new CoVEs - developing their excellence potential Projects should develop on one or more of the following directions: CoVE focussed initiatives to modernise and transform the quality of VET systems to strategically support social, economic and pedagogical changes and challenges, e.g. new skill needs in the context of the green and digital transition The formation of multilevel Public Private Partnerships for VET and skills development Actions aimed towards embedding CoVEs in local innovation ecosystems and connecting them at the Danube level Facilitating the bringing together of CoVEs that share a common interest in specific sectors and innovative approaches to tackling societal challenges e.g. social inclusion, green skills, digitalisation, AI, upskilling individuals with low qualification levels, etc. Specific Objective 4.2 - Increased institutional capacities for territorial and macro-regional governance Four 3rd call thematic focuses have been identified for specific objective 4.2.

Please find more information below. read more Expected results Specific Objective 1.2 - Development of skills for advancing smart specialisation strategies, industrial transformation and transition towards industry 4.0, including cross-sectorial collaborations The key goals of SO 1.2 in this CfP are: Develop AI-related skills that enhance the delivery of transnational products and services by supporting SMEs, start-ups and professionals in adopting AI-driven solutions for business growth Integration of existing AI solutions into transnational, digital (data-based) ecosystems that utilise technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), block chain, XR, digital twins and cloud solutions Promote ethical AI, data literacy, and responsible AI development across industries Strengthen cooperation between educational institutions, businesses, and policymakers to build an AI-ready workforce Foster AI-driven entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystems in the Danube Region Development of a common transnational AI competence framework for the Danube Region Development and training of methods and tools for SMES in the Danube Region to test and securely operate AI solutions Build on AI-oriented existing, complimentary platforms and services, that contribute to the implementation of the Danube strategy Proposed projects should focus on some of the following areas: AI ethics and governance: development and training on ethical AI use, bias detection, and regulatory compliance to ensure responsible AI deployment AI in entrepreneurship: support for AI start-ups through incubations programs, mentorship, and funding guidance Transnational AI collaboration: joint projects between universities, research centres, and businesses to develop transnational solutions related to the use or application of AI such as: AI training and education: development of AI training programmes, workshops, and certification courses for students and professionals AI for business applications: practical training on AI-powered tools for industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and healthcare AI and digital transformation: programs that help organisations integrate AI into their operations to enhance productivity and efficiency AI for Sustainability: AI-driven innovations for climate monitoring, smart cities, and sustainable resource management Integration of AI solutions into transnational, digital ecosystems Depending on their objectives, successful projects should demonstrate the following: Increased AI literacy and practical AI skills among professionals of public organisations piloted and tested in their role of supporting businesses in delivering transnational products and services Development of AI-based learning materials, training platforms, and certification programmes Strengthened transnational collaboration in AI research and development AI-driven solutions that enhance economic and social development Measures that enable SMEs to better utilise AI Increased connection of stakeholders with AI experience with SMEs that lack experience Cooperation with existing and well-functioning organizational structures under the EU Strategy for Danube Region Specific Objective 2.1 - Support greening the energy and transport sectors in the Danube Region by enhancing the integration of renewable energy sources To maximise the impact generated by corresponding activities the call is focused on small and medium municipalities to motivate them to participate in the energy transition. Applicants are encouraged to make use of the capitalization opportunities with ongoing 1st call projects like Danube geoHeCo, REHEATEAST, StoreMore, ESINERGY, SMEnergy, NRGCOM, and DECA, Danube Indeet who already created topic-wise a good foundation that could possibly be taken up or even developed further. To facilitate financing solutions for relevant investments for small and medium municipalities, initiatives such as the European City Facility (EUCF) - that was set up under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation of the European Union, and is currently being funded as part of the Life Programme - is also recommended. Specific Objective 2.2 - Promoting climate change adaptation capacities in the Danube Region and disaster management on transnational level in relation to environmental risks taking into account ecosystem-based approaches no further specifications Specific Objective 2.3 - Sustainable, integrated, transnational water and sediment management in the Danube River Basin ensuring good quality and quantity of waters and sediment balance no further specifications Specific Objective 3.1 - Accessible, inclusive and effective labour markets Indicative examples (non-exhaustive): Creation of an information system and support for the provision of information and data about life events connected to the periodic and permanent migration of workforce, caused by labour market inequalities between the eastern and the western parts of the macro region Build-up of a “Danube observatory system” about labour migration and its impacts on cohesion, involving public bodies responsible for monitoring and evaluation, academia and civil society Specific Objective 3.2 - Accessible and inclusive quality services in education, training and lifelong learning Vocational education and training systems demonstrate a range of approaches in the fourteen countries of the Danube Region (DR), varying based on national and regional policies, cultural values, and economic and social needs. However, significant common connections and challenges bind labour markets, supportive VET systems, providers and learners together. These include demographic change, migration, digital transformation and the green transition, which are all testing the agility of VET systems to meet the needs of changing labour markets and society. The Danube Region Programme recognises the importance of addressing this with transnational partnerships to complement national, regional and local initiatives. Working through Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs), the programme seeks to do this with two approaches. One strategic and one more operational. In considering CoVEs, the programme recognises that there is not a single uniform accepted definition of a CoVE, but it considers all of the following characteristics to be important in CoVE identification: recognised in its field as high-quality VET provision role in promoting regional development and employment local skills ecosystem: hub for innovation and knowledge transfer, and fostering collaboration between education, businesses, the community, public administration and other stakeholders connected and active internationally Well-considered applications should create a differentiated understanding in terms of their CoVE identification as opposed to the more standard VET providers/provision. The programme also considers excellence in the context of CoVEs as a wide-reaching and inclusive concept of skills provision which encompasses pedagogy, social justice, lifelong learning, transversal skills, organization, innovation, continuing professional education and community needs. Specific Objective 4.2 - Increased institutional capacities for territorial and macro-regional governance 3rd call thematic focus 1: Tackling the accelerated territorial peripheralization/ polarization within the Danube Region and promoting balanced territorial and social-economic development, considering main demographic developments and recent technological advances Increasing regional disparities are a specific feature of the Danube Region and closely connected to beneath working demographic trends like brain drain, depopulation or deterioration of rural and remote areas. In addition, recent technological advances have the potential to further “fuel” the already ongoing territorial polarization. These inter-linked phenomena are not only aggravating the living-conditions in wide areas of the Danube Region and for certain demographic groups (e.g. youth, elderly or low-qualified workers) but are affecting the (global) competitiveness of the Danube Region as such. Projects tackling single aspects in this field have been (successfully) realised, yet a much broader and comprehensive strategic initiatives are needed for filling evidence gaps, defining a common territorial vision and introducing targeted and sustainable measures for mitigating or reversing existing mis-developments. Main activities shall be grouped around improving and transnationally harmonizing the evidence-base in relation to the topics concerned, a better and more effective alignment of policies needed for counter-balancing the accelerated polarisation within the Danube region and the empowerment of local actors for successfully testing and implementing sustainable solutions. Main outputs and results shall cover a governance model vertically and horizontally integrating core-actors in the field concerned, evidence-based and transnationally applicable policy documents as well as tools and action plans for their local implementation. 3rd call thematic focus 2: Making local (and regional) public governance systems more resilient to crisis-situations (“crisis proof”) The COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine showed that crisis-situations not known for decades (or not known at all) suddenly can become real and influence basically all spheres of life. A specific contribution of SO4.2 in this context could consist in developing a framework for improving capacities for the crisis-preparedness especially of local public bodies in fields such as civil protection, maintaining critical infrastructure, dealing with de-stabilizing actions like cyber-attacks or misinformation and providing vital public services. Main activities shall tackle the analysis of crisis-scenarios especially in view of capacities needed for ensuring an adequate preparedness of local actors in the most vital fields, the creation of transnational coordination mechanisms in the field concerned. The main outputs and results are to be seen in an integrated transnational governance system for crisis-preparedness overcoming the existent fragmentation (in terms key-actors, frameworks and mechanisms) along “traditional” intervention fields like health, environment or safety. 3rd call thematic focus 3: Innovating and optimizing models of effectively involving citizens in transnational, multi-level territorial planning processes and promoting sustainable democracy Models of local self-government and community engagement are multifaceted and have a long tradition in the Danube Region. Yet the big pictures shows that many of Europe’s “low-trust-societies” with a low level of active participation in civil society are concentrated on this cooperation area. Larger strategic initiatives are an adequate tool for pooling existing experiences and key-actors and for introducing and testing new models. Whereas democratic participation in general decision making and territorial planning processes can be seen as the core-challenge in this field, new emerging phenomena (like the need for improved media literacy for confronting disinformation campaigns and fake news spreading through digital media) shall be considered too, not only, but also because they affect in particular the youth. Main activities shall focus on the creation and testing of new models for local civic participation or the role – potentials, limitations, risks – of new technological phenomena like social media or AI in increasing institutional trust in the Danube Region. The main output/result envisaged is a platform acting as an incubator for innovating participation models and tools and for boosting the cooperation among key civic actors across the cooperation area. 3rd call thematic focus 4: Strengthening transnational capacities of public local and regional governance systems for ensuring the functioning of Global / European / Danubian Value Chains The war in Ukraine highlighted the complex connections within global value chains and how disruptions in one area can affect different sectors and regions across the EU. The Danube Region – as Europe’s macro-region directly neighbouring a geopolitically more and more instable space – is both more exposed to threads resulting from recent developments and can at the same time contribute more and more directly to overcome (or mitigate) these threads. S.O.4.2 could offer a platform for tackling a specific aspect in this context, i.e. the role of local and regional governments in their interaction with businesses and civil actors for ensuring an effective and sustainable functioning of vital value chains. Main activities shall aim at analysing the vulnerability of crucial value chains from a transnational perspective and the role of local public bodies for ensuring their effective functioning. The main output/result is to be seen in the creation of a coordination mechanism for Danubian value chains and increased capacities of local public bodies for sustaining critical value chains. read more',

    'short description The Danube Region Programme (DRP) is launching the 3rd Call for Proposals (CfP). The programme offers financial support to transnational projects contributing to the development of a more innovative, sustainable and more social Danube Region. The programme has been designed under the territorial cooperation goal of the European Union. The uniqueness of the programme consists of offering a platform for cooperation in strategic areas between EU Member States and non-EU Partner States in the Danube region. In this CfP, applicants can submit proposals under the following Specific Objectives: SO1.2, SO2.1, SO2.2, SO2.3, SO3.1. SO3.2 and SO4.2. Furthermore, this CfP is a targeted call. It means that only proposals addressing the thematic focuses defined in the Call announcement can be funded by the Programme. Call objectives Specific Objective 1.2 - Development of skills for advancing smart specialisation strategies, industrial transformation and transition towards industry 4.0, including cross-sectorial collaborations 3rd call thematic focus: AI skills development for delivering products and services with transnational impact in the Danube Region Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and redefining how businesses operate globally. In the Danube Region, there is an urgent need to equip organisations with AI-related skills to enhance competitiveness, drive innovation, and ensure sustainable economic growth. This 3rd call thematic scope is also strongly linked to the EC COM (2025) 163 A modernised Cohesion policy: The mid-term review stating that “digitalisation of public services and the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the public and private sectors are levers for competitiveness. This 3rd CfP is targeting projects that foster AI skills development, enabling primarily public and private non-profit organisations supporting businesses, start-ups, and professionals to leverage AI technologies for transnational collaboration, digital transformation, and creation of high-value products and services. Specific Objective 2.1 - Support greening the energy and transport sectors in the Danube Region by enhancing the integration of renewable energy sources 3rd call thematic focus: Considering the provisions outlined in the “Energy transition” section of “A modernised Cohesion policy: The mid-term review” (MTR, COM(2025) 163 final) published by the European Commission and taking into account the still growing need for sustainable, renewable energy solutions in line with the IP of the Interreg Danube Region highlights the necessity to define a targeted 3rd call for “sustainable renewable energy solutions in the context of energy production, heating and cooling systems, grid load, energy communities, district heating and cooling, storage and peak load reduction” directly linked to focus 1 of SO2.1 “Increasing the share of renewable energy in the Danube region”. Specific Objective 2.2 - Promoting climate change adaptation capacities in the Danube Region and disaster management on transnational level in relation to environmental risks taking into account ecosystem-based approaches 3rd call thematic focus: The proposed applications can address the three thematic focuses of SO 2.2, but should target broader territorial scope beyond the urban, municipal level, where transnational level harmonisation and coordination of forecasting, monitoring, preparedness, or reaction is necessary (targeting the Danube River Basin, or its main sub-basins, or the Danube Region, a thematically reasonable, broad and coherent transnational space within, covering the targeted area in its entirety – e.g. a transnational river network, a broad transnational area of DR affected by the same environmental risk with potential transboundary impact) in connection to climate change adaptation and / or climate change induced environmental risks (floods, droughts, wild fires),or accidental pollution of rivers. Specific Objective 2.3 - Sustainable, integrated, transnational water and sediment management in the Danube River Basin ensuring good quality and quantity of waters and sediment balance 3rd call thematic focus: Proposals can address thematic focus 2 (harmonising management practices between relevant sectors to improve the quality and quantity of transnational water bodies) and thematic focus 3 (transnational coordination of water supply management in transnational river(basin)s) of SO2.3. More specifically, the proposed applications should target potential impacts of climate change on transnational water management by harmonising and coordinating policy approaches, management practises between water management, agriculture, environment, navigation and hydropower to improve the quantity (and quality) of water in transnational river systems of DRB with key topics in relation to water scarcity, balanced use of water and coordinated management of low-water periods on transnational rivers of DRB (considering also that flood management is related to SO 2.2). This thematic scope is also in strong connection with the COM/2025/0084 regulation proposal, which aligns cohesion policy investments to the new challenges and priorities identified by the mid-term review of the Cohesion Policy, among others adding water resilience to the scope of water management. The geographic scope of the proposals shall be on the whole Danube River Basin, or at least a sufficiently broad part of it, major transnational river(s), river basin and possibly in the entirety of the targeted river basin. Specific Objective 3.1 - Accessible, inclusive and effective labour markets 3rd call thematic focus: Capacity building for employment support bodies (information and data systems; coordination; training e.g. in social economy). The context in which employment services are operating in the Danube Region is characterised by rapid change, driven in large part by demographic shifts, migration, digital transformation and the green transition. Consequently, new forms of employment, skills, social attitudes and career paths are needed in the DR to support our labour markets and society more widely. Our aim is to build the capacity of employment services to respond to the challenges and prepare services in support of effective, agile, inclusive and resilient labour markets. This could include new or improved information and data systems; coordinating structures and processes between services and supporting stakeholders; developing service capacity through innovative training methodologies - for example in social economy, AI, skills assessment, inclusion, etc. Indicative examples from one of the DR challenges, of the type of approaches that could fit within the scope of this specific objective can be seen below. Specific Objective 3.2 - Accessible and inclusive quality services in education, training and lifelong learning 3rd call thematic focus 1: To strengthen Danube Region strategic approaches in support of Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs) in the Danube Region. A Danube Region strategic support approach for CoVEs should build on the work of the existing EUSDR Danube Region Platform on Centres of Vocational Excellence/Policy Platform for CoVEs started in 2021 Danube Region Platform on Centres of Vocational Excellence - EUSDR - Danube Strategy Point. A Danube Region project(s) could complement and further develop this initiative with a more coordinating/operational approach, which could include: Pilot programmes of work with a transnational character on specific areas of work, e.g. internationalization of CoVEs, CoVEs and social inclusion, public private partnerships; CoVEs and smart specialization; lifelong learning Creating networks, forums and working groups on specific themes connecting VET policy makers and providers with companies and industry representatives across the Danube Region Developing a support function for the understanding, guidance and complementarity of different programmes in the Danube Region supporting CoVEs (national, regional, transnational) Awareness and capacity building programmes for CoVEs in the Danube Region Strategic CoVE development in fields of transnational interest across the Danube Region 3rd call thematic focus 2: The development of existing CoVEs or new CoVEs - developing their excellence potential Projects should develop on one or more of the following directions: CoVE focussed initiatives to modernise and transform the quality of VET systems to strategically support social, economic and pedagogical changes and challenges, e.g. new skill needs in the context of the green and digital transition The formation of multilevel Public Private Partnerships for VET and skills development Actions aimed towards embedding CoVEs in local innovation ecosystems and connecting them at the Danube level Facilitating the bringing together of CoVEs that share a common interest in specific sectors and innovative approaches to tackling societal challenges e.g. social inclusion, green skills, digitalisation, AI, upskilling individuals with low qualification levels, etc. Specific Objective 4.2 - Increased institutional capacities for territorial and macro-regional governance Four 3rd call thematic focuses have been identified for specific objective 4.2. Applicants are not requested to address all the four thematic focuses of the 3rd call, but they shall concentrate on and demonstrate in their application strong contribution to at least one thematic focus. Addressing two or more thematic focuses is not considered an advantage for the applicant and will not lead to additional points automatically since the assessment considers the quality of the proposal in its entirety.

    'short description The call invites organisations from across central Europe to submit transnational cooperation ideas for strategic projects for capitalisation, using the potential to team up efforts between cross-border and transnational projects, strengthening the impact of Interreg as a whole for the benefit of the central Europe area. The overall objective of the call is to reduce the effects of borders on flows and functional linkages among central European regions, for a more competitive and resilient central Europe. Call objectives The programme mission is to bring regions and cities together beyond borders to find fitting solutions for their citizens – in a fair and equal way everywhere. It encourages and supports transnational cooperation to make regions more resilient to common challenges that know no borders and which cannot be solved alone. These challenges include among others economic transition processes, climate change, and the long-term socioeconomic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. The programme priorities and specific objectives form the backbone of the Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE funding strategy in 2021-27. In line with the thematic fields, transnational cooperation actions are expected to address the development and implementation of strategies, action plans, tools, training, pilot actions and related solutions. All actions will have to respect the horizontal principles of sustainable development including environmental protection as well as equal opportunities, non-discrimination and gender equality. Priority 1: Cooperating for a smarter central Europe SO 1.1 Strengthening innovation capacities in central Europe Strong innovation capacities bear enormous relevance for central Europe considering its strong industrial base and the importance of sectors such as agriculture and food, or tourism. Innovation is also central for strengthening central Europe’s economic resilience. Capacities for innovation need to be fostered especially in regions that are struggling with the transition to a more globalised, digitalised and green economy. Knowledge and technology transfer, especially for SMEs, is a critical need. SO 1.2 Strenghtening skills for smart specialisation, industrial transition and entrepreneurship in central Europe The strong industrial base of central Europe and its dependence on adequate skills underlines the strategic relevance of this specific objective. SMEs have been identified as the main providers of employment in central Europe and it is important to foster locally available human skills, especially for the transition to Industry 4.0, digitalisation and a green economy. Capacities for an efficient entrepreneurial discovery process need to be improved as well as for the preparation or updating of smart specialisation strategies. Place-based development of skills is also crucial for reducing urban-rural disparities. Overall, there is the need for a just transition process that is socially responsible. Priority 2: Cooperating for a greener central Europe SO 2.1 Supporting the energy transition to a climate-neutral central Europe Central Europe needs to speed up its performance related both to energy efficiency as well as the production and use of renewable energy to meet EU targets and climate objectives of the European Green Deal. Significant regional disparities between central European regions have to be tackled. Energy efficiency and renewable energy need to be promoted and exploited to reach a wider geographical coverage. SO 2.2. Increasing the resilience to climate change risks in central Europe Resilience to climate change risks represents an important need for central Europe, especially in view of its significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. A specific territorial aspect is the need for integrated and cross-sectoral approaches to best adapt to climate change. In order to build up climate resilience, general approaches need to be locally adapted towards workable and manageable, integrated solutions which can be proliferated across the entire central Europe area. SO 2.3. Taking circular economy forward in central Europe A climate-neutral, resource-efficient and competitive economy requires up-scaled circular approaches. This economic transformation has to pay attention to the fact that a circular economy will often require a re- arrangement of value chains, changes of interdependencies and the creation of new profit options. It is important that this socio-economic transformation happens across the entire territory of central Europe and does not concentrate on only a few regions. SO 2.4. Safeguarding the environment in central Europe The economic and environmental significance of natural assets and landscapes in central Europe calls for a co-ordinated valorisation and protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. There is a strong need to counteract negative effects of human action through integrated environmental management approaches. SO 2.5. Greening urban mobility in central Europe A reduction of transport emissions is one of the key targets of the European Green Deal. Smart and greener urban mobility will need an integrated response. Many functional urban areas in central Europe face similar challenges when greening their mobility. The specific territorial need lies in the vast diversity of topics (e.g. pollution and congestion) that need to be addressed in an integrated approach. Furthermore, the topic does not only include different ways of mobility, but also urban as well as urban-rural logistics. Priority 3: Cooperating for a better connected Europe SO 3.1. Improving transport connections of rural and peripheral regions in central Europe The programme area is a relevant junction in Europe. This can strategically facilitate the participation in trade and increase competitiveness. Accessibility to larger transport corridors is, however, comparatively weak. There is a need to link especially peripheral regions to the nodes of the TEN-T core network corridors (CNC), to remove bottlenecks and to bridge missing transport links in order to ensure good accessibility across central Europe. Furthermore, there is the need to reduce transport emissions by 90% by 2050, which calls for smart and sustainable approaches to cross-border mobility, intermodality and the introduction of IT-supported solutions for mobility management. Priority 4: Improving governance for cooperation in central Europe SO 4.1 Strengthening governance for integrated territorial development in central Europe Central Europe is highly heterogeneous both in territorial as well as in socio-economic terms. A multitude of challenges and barriers hinders the economic, social and territorial development in central Europe, which are not necessarily bound to specific administrative units. They rather relate to areas with functional ties that are characterised by economic, social, and environmental linkages. Addressing these territorial development challenges calls for integrated multi-level and multi-sectoral governance processes that consider functional linkages at the territorial level. There is a need to improve capacities of public authorities on all territorial levels for setting up and implementing integrated territorial development strategies. Cooperation should be encouraged within and between territories that are sharing functional ties. read more Expected effects and impacts Strategic projects for capitalisation are to take up existing Interreg transnational and cross-border outputs and results, to meet existing and new needs and strengthen their territorial and policy impact in wider areas, also beyond border regions. They must go beyond a mere pooling or duplication of what already exists. Instead, they should further develop, improve, or adapt existing outputs and results by drawing on the experience of more projects. These projects unlock synergies, strengthen networks, boost visibility and attract political attention, ensuring that successful ideas go further and reach wider. Above all, they must clearly show how they add value beyond what has already been achieved. Focus should be on quality over quantity, carefully selecting only the most relevant outputs and results to address specific challenges and needs. Capitalisation can be implemented in two different ways. Both approaches are complementary and a combination of the two in one strategic project for capitalisation is possible. Upstreaming: Existing outputs and results are taken up and tailored in a way that policy makers can address border issues through new or improved territorial or thematic policies and strategies. This should happen at the most appropriate level (i.e. European, national, regional or local). Downstreaming: Existing outputs and results are tailored in a way that they can be further rolled-out at the most appropriate level. Such roll-out could be “territorial” in case the adapted outputs and results are applied in other regions facing similar issues; or “sectoral” when the adapted outputs and results are applied to other sectors than the ones initially addressed. Given that strategic projects for capitalisation are to be regarded as “operations of strategic importance”, they shall comply with specific communication requirements set by the European Commission for these projects for ensuring high visibility and engagement. In addition to branding and visibility requirements outlined in chapter I.4.4.2 of the programme manual, projects shall: Organise at least one communication event involving the programme managing authority and representatives of the European Commission in a timely manner. Contribute to joint programme-level communication activities, such as events, campaigns, or thematic publications. Strategic projects for capitalisation will be closely monitored by the programme, examining their implementation progress and strategic contribution. read more Expected results Strategic projects for capitalisation can address all topics specified in chapter 2 of the Interreg Programme (IP) document for each programme specific objective (SO), without restrictions. Applicants are however, encouraged to consider in particular those thematic areas concerning the most significant central European territorial challenges as well as showing a higher potential to capitalise existing Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE and cross-border achievements.
