      'short description The initiative is structured around two complementary and mutually reinforcing objectives. Together, they aim to lay the foundations for a European model of AI-enabled cardiovascular and comorbid chronic disease care, grounded in high-quality health data and real-world validated solutions. Call objectives This initiative aims to leverage AI and health data to accelerate the early detection, prediction, personalised prevention, integrated management and rehabilitation of CVDs and related NCDs, including rare and complex forms. Objective 1 — Leveraging Health Data for AI Applications in Cardiovascular and Related Chronic Diseases The first objective is to structure, federate, and enable access to high-quality health data across the Union to support the development, training, validation, and deployment of AI tools focused on cardiovascular diseases and related non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and obesity). This will align with and prepare for the future application the EHDS, which provides the regulatory and technical framework to enable the secure, privacy preserving, and interoperable secondary use of health data across Member States. Objective 2 — Deploying AI Solutions for Risk Prediction, Prevention, Treatments, and Personalised Care The second objective is to identify, validate, and scale up mature AI applications capable of improving the risk prediction, early detection, personalised prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of cardiovascular and related chronic diseases. read more Expected effects and impacts Improved health outcomes: Earlier diagnosis and more targeted prevention of NCDs, leading to reduced disease progression, complications, and avoidable mortality. Greater equity: Enhanced access to personalised diagnostics and AI-supported care pathways, especially in underserved regions or Member States with limited innovation capacity. Efficiency and sustainability of health systems: Better use of resources through predictive and preventive approaches, reducing the burden of chronic conditions on healthcare infrastructures. Trust in European health AI: By ensuring compliance with data protection, safety, and transparency standards, the initiative will foster trust in the responsible use of AI for health in line with the AI Act and EHDS Regulation. It will also support the uptake — and where relevant, the development — of specifications and standards foreseen under both frameworks, notably for interoperability, risk management and data governance read more Expected results This initiative is expected to generate tangible, scalable results supporting the adoption of AIdriven personalised care for cardiovascular diseases and related non-communicable conditions, while laying the foundations of a trusted European data ecosystem for health innovation. Expected results – Data dimension Creation of a large-scale, federated, high-quality dataset for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, aligned with the EHDS framework. This dataset will be representative, inclusive, and interoperable, and will enable the development, training and benchmarking of AI tools across borders. Definition and uptake of minimum technical specifications for cardiovascular datasets, including structured phenotypes, genetic and biometric markers, and metadata quality labelling. Expected results – AI adoption dimension Validated AI solutions: A portfolio of AI tools will be piloted in real-world clinical settings, with demonstrated effectiveness in early detection, risk prediction, and personalised prevention of cardiovascular and related chronic diseases. Deployment frameworks: The initiative will produce practical guidelines and protocols to facilitate the integration and scale-up of AI applications across diverse healthcare systems. These will cover governance, interoperability, clinician training, patient engagement, and continuous performance monitoring. Strategic guidance: The publication of a roadmap and a blueprint for large-scale integration will inform health authorities, hospitals, and policymakers on how to responsibly and sustainably adopt AI tools, supporting informed decisions at national and Union levels. Robust evidence base: The project will generate comparative data on safety, performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness), usability and acceptability, informing both clinical practice and health policy. read more',

      'short description This action will provide EURIPID members with a better overview of access, P&R measures and decisions across the Member States. Call objectives The objectives are to: measure and increase understanding of patient access to medicines in the Union; increase the quality of the database, in terms of timely/correct data delivery; expand the scope of the EURIPID members (to all the Member States) and data; leverage usefulness of the data beyond external reference pricing purposes. Expected effects and impacts In the longer term, it is expected to support mutual learning between national authorities and help the Member States in taking better pricing and reimbursement decisions, with a view to improve access, availability, and affordability of medicines. This is in line with the recommendations in the Draghi Report on the future of European competitiveness, and with the priority to ensure supply of affordable medicines, as outlined in the mission letter from Commission President von der Leyen to the Commissioner for Health and Animal Welfare. The proposed “pricing and reimbursement (‘P&R’) tracker” and access dashboard will allow improved monitoring of patients’ access to medicines across the Union, including for cancer treatments. Having this data available prior to the application of the proposed pharmaceutical reform, will serve to measure the baseline and subsequently the impact of the proposed measures that aim to increase access to medicines across the Union, including for cancer treatments. read more Expected results The objectives are to: measure and increase understanding of patient access to medicines in the Union; increase the quality of the database, in terms of timely/correct data delivery; expand the scope of the EURIPID members (to all the Member States) and data; leverage usefulness of the data beyond external reference pricing purposes.',

The conferences will cover important health topics that are related to the Union’s health priorities, and thereby contribute to the development and implementation of the European Health Union. Call objectives These conferences are an opportunity for discussion on how to work better together at Union level on one or more health-related topics and will allow Member States, third countries associated to the EU4Health Programme and relevant stakeholders to exchange information and good practices on relevant topics in the field of public health. Grants may be awarded to support the organisation of conferences that correspond to the objectives and the priorities of the EU4Health Programme, and which have a Union-wide dimension. Expected results The conferences should include high level speakers, and a representative number of participants from all relevant fields of the challenges to be discussed. The action will support communication activities addressed to the general public and/or to specific groups of people or health professionals, in order to promote the European Health Union and its different initiatives. Conferences must have a Union-wide dimension. The conferences will not focus on a specific condition or disease however, they will focus on current cross-cutting Union policy issues.',
