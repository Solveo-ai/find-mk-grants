    'short description This Call aims at accrediting recognised Higher Education Institutions located in eligible countries, which have operational capacity to take part in Erasmus+ Programme’s activities, such as learning mobility of individuals and/or cooperation for innovation and good practices. Call objectives The Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE) is an EU quality certificate for higher education institutions (HEIs). It is a prerequisite for all HEIs from Erasmus+ Programme countries and Western Balkans third countries not associated to the Programme to apply for funding under Erasmus+ calls (including calls managed by Erasmus+ National Agencies). By applying for the ECHE, the HEI confirms that its participation in Erasmus+ is part of its strategy for modernisation and internationalisation. This strategy acknowledges the key contribution of student and staff mobility and of participation in transnational cooperation projects, to the quality of its higher education programmes and student experience. The ECHE aims to reinforce the quality of student and staff mobility, as well as of cooperation projects. The certification procedure consists in validating the status as a ‘higher education institution (HEI)’ and certifying compliance with the ECHE quality standards (Erasmus Policy Statement, quality of organisation and management structures and the implementation of ECHE principles). The ECHE will be valid for the entire duration of the Erasmus+ Programme 2021-2027 (and up until the end of projects funded under that Programme). The award of the ECHE does not automatically imply any direct funding under the Erasmus+ Programme. ECHE holders will be subject to regular monitoring by the National Agencies. read more',

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipBoth partners with their own budget (project partners) and partners without their own budget (associated partners) can participate in an Interreg project. The basic rule in the program is that at least one Polish and one German partner always participate in the project - both with ERDF funds. Normally, all project partners are based in the participating regions of the program area. In justified exceptional cases, project partners based outside the program area can also participate in an Interreg project. The decisive prerequisite is that the project-related activities of the partner are carried out for the program area, achieve a visible added value for it and are essential for the implementation of the project. Project partners can be both public and private organizations. The project partners must nominate a lead partner. Only public organizations may assume this function in the program. The project partners must cooperate on the following two levels within the framework of the project: Joint preparation: regular meetings or coordination on project development, joint development of project content, objectives and scheduling, joint preparation of project documents. Joint implementation: activities of all project partners coordinated in terms of content and timing, joint project coordination, each project partner takes on at least one sub-task. In addition, the partners must cooperate on at least one of the following levels: Joint personnel: one or more project partners provide additional personnel or release existing personnel to carry out project tasks in the interests of all project partners. Joint financing: joint cost and financing plan of the project partners, in which each project partner assumes part of its own funds, each project partner pre-finances its share of the costs. Examples of recipients of funds Priority 2: State administrations Local and regional authorities and government agencies Universities and research institutions Non-governmental organizations and non-profit companies and institutions Priority 3: Education and training providers and universities Units of territorial self-government and state education administration Chambers of industry, commerce and crafts and other business-related institutions Trade unions employment offices Non-governmental organizations and non-profit companies and institutions. other eligibility criteriaOn the Polish side, the program area covers the entire West Pomeranian Voivodeship. On the German side, it covers the districts of Vorpommern-Greifswald, Vorpommern-Rügen and Mecklenburgische Seenplatte in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the districts of Uckermark, Barnim and Märkisch-Oderland in Brandenburg. Normally, all project partners are based in the participating regions of the program area (program handbook chapter 1.3 Program area). As far as a more effective and higher cross-border added value of the projects is possible, the program also encourages project partners from the other German-Polish funding areas to be involved in the project implementation across the program. In justified exceptional cases, project partners based outside the program area can also participate in an Interreg project. The decisive prerequisite is that the project-related activities of the partner are carried out for the program area, achieve a visible added value for the program area and are essential for the implementation of the project. A lump sum of EUR 10,560.00 ERDF can be applied for to cover project preparation costs. A lump sum of EUR 6,720.00 ERDF can be applied for for project completion costs. Projects with a total budget of more than EUR 200,000 are considered regular projects. Projects with a total budget of up to EUR 200,000 and which are not carried out within the Small Project Fund (SPF) are to be treated as small-scale projects (Program Guide Chapter 4.4.3 Draft Budget). Funding applications in this call must have a minimum budget of over EUR 50,000 ERDF. Budget of the call: P2: Overcoming the consequences of climate change together and preserving nature SO 2.1: Adaptation to climate change: EUR 11,024,693.15 SO 2.2: Nature conservation and biodiversity: EUR 6,503,402.17 P3: Enabling better cross-border participation through language, culture and tourism SO 3.1: Education: EUR 6,431,476.51',

    'short description This Call aims at accrediting recognised Higher Education Institutions located in eligible countries, which have operational capacity to take part in Erasmus+ Programme’s activities, such as learning mobility of individuals and/or cooperation for innovation and good practices. Call objectives The Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE) is an EU quality certificate for higher education institutions (HEIs). It is a prerequisite for all HEIs from Erasmus+ Programme countries and Western Balkans third countries not associated to the Programme to apply for funding under Erasmus+ calls (including calls managed by Erasmus+ National Agencies). By applying for the ECHE, the HEI confirms that its participation in Erasmus+ is part of its strategy for modernisation and internationalisation. This strategy acknowledges the key contribution of student and staff mobility and of participation in transnational cooperation projects, to the quality of its higher education programmes and student experience. The ECHE aims to reinforce the quality of student and staff mobility, as well as of cooperation projects. The certification procedure consists in validating the status as a ‘higher education institution (HEI)’ and certifying compliance with the ECHE quality standards (Erasmus Policy Statement, quality of organisation and management structures and the implementation of ECHE principles). The ECHE will be valid for the entire duration of the Erasmus+ Programme 2021-2027 (and up until the end of projects funded under that Programme). The award of the ECHE does not automatically imply any direct funding under the Erasmus+ Programme. ECHE holders will be subject to regular monitoring by the National Agencies. read more',
