    'short description The security of the implementations of PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) algorithms is vital for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of digital information and communications in the face of implementation attacks, such as, for example, side-channel attacks using information from timing, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, fault attacks disturbing the secure of operation of the device and their combination. Such attacks, eventually also enhanced by the use of deep learning, constitute significant threats to both (embedded and regular) software and hardware implementations. Call objectives In various application areas such as IoT, cloud-based applications, automotive, measures to prevent such attacks currently lead to substantial resource overhead due to the complexity of the algorithms, and the security remains unclear given the limited exploration of different attack surfaces.

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipTo be eligible for funding, applicants must be established in one of the following countries: the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows: at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries. Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. Specific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, participation in this topic is limited to legal entities established in Member States and Associated Countries and OECD countries. In order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, shall not participate in the action.',

    'short description The National Coordination Centres (NCCs) set up by the Regulation (EU) 2021/887 are designed to work together through a network and to contribute to achieving the objectives of the regulation and to foster the Cybersecurity Competence Community in each Member State, by contributing to the acquisition of the necessary capacity. National Coordination Centres can also support priority areas such as the implementation of EU legislation (Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the proposed Cyber Resilience Act and the Cybersecurity Act). Call objectives The objective of this topic is to support the operation of the NCCs and to enable them to support the cybersecurity community, including SMEs, for the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions and strengthen cybersecurity capacities. This could also be achieved by using Financial Support for Third Parties (FSTPs). Based on the financing received in previous years and on the different operational start dates in the Member States, this activity aims to continue providing support for NCCs. In this regard, it is important to stress that individual NCC can choose from the list of activities and deliverables included in this topic depending on their interest and mandate. There is no obligation for NCCs to execute all actions. This topic also considers providing support for the uptake of EU cybersecurity technologies and products, commercialisation and scale-up of the European cybersecurity start-up/SME ecosystem, in collaboration and complementarity with the European and ongoing national and regional initiatives, such as accelerator and incubation programmes and technology transfer programmes. Such a strategy should also include support for scale-ups, considering the use of public procurement and private investment. An essential aspect of this action is to create a framework for the emergence of such incubators and accelerators in the Member States, based on best practices and considering the specific needs and requirements arising from EU legislation (such as the Cyber Resilience Act, NIS 2 Directive). In addition, this topic could contribute to cybersecurity awareness. It is becoming increasingly important to inform and educate EU citizens on cybersecurity topics in their daily use of digital technologies. Cybersecurity awareness helps individuals and organisations to identify threats and take appropriate action. By promoting awareness, the likelihood of incidents and data breaches can be reduced. Within this topic, NCCs are encouraged to build upon ongoing initiatives, including for example the ones from the EC and ENISA, to improve the awareness of EU citizens, businesses and organisations about cybersecurity risks and threats and to support Europe-wide actions to increase the number of students in cybersecurity courses, students engaged in cybersecurity research activities and students and young professionals choosing a career in cybersecurity. Furthermore, European companies are innovative and develop highly competitive products, but the still underdeveloped Digital Single Market confines most of these companies (especially SMEs and start-ups) to their home country. A platform that can open the European market for small and medium-sized enterprises would also act as a springboard into international markets. This platform will ensure the competitiveness of European cybersecurity solutions. As such, this topic could also support the EU market’s growth in cybersecurity products and services by providing a platform on which European SMEs and start-ups can post their (market-ready) products and solutions and on which businesses, public authorities and private individuals can search for the best solution for their needs, regardless of the country. The National Coordination Centre should carry out, depending on their decision, one or more of the following tasks: Acting as contact points at the national level for the Cybersecurity Competence Community to support the ECCC in achieving its objectives and missions. Providing expertise and actively contributing to the strategic tasks of the ECCC, taking into account relevant national and regional challenges for cybersecurity in different sectors and deliver tasks supporting the implementation of the Cyber skills Academy. Promoting, encouraging and facilitating the participation of civil society and industry, in particular start-ups and SMEs, academic and research communities and other actors at Member State level in cross-border projects and cybersecurity actions funded through all relevant Union programmes. Providing technical assistance to stakeholders by supporting stakeholders in their application phase for projects managed by the ECCC, and in full compliance with the rules of sound financial management, especially on conflicts of interests. This should be done in close coordination with the relevant NCPs set up by the Member States. Seeking to establish synergies with relevant activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies. Where relevant, implementing specific actions for which grants have been awarded by the ECCC, including through the provision of financial support to third parties in accordance with Article 204 of the Financial Regulation under the conditions specified in the grant agreements concerned, in particular aimed at strengthening the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions (notably by SMEs). Supporting the scaling-up of start-ups by finding other funding to implement existing projects. Promoting and disseminating the relevant outcomes of the work of the Network and the ECCC at national, regional or local level. assessing requests for becoming part of the Cybersecurity Competence Community by entities established in the same Member State as the NCC. advocating and promoting involvement by relevant entities in the activities arising from the ECCC, the Network of National Coordination Centres, and the Cybersecurity Competence Community, and monitoring, as appropriate, the level of engagement with actions awarded for cybersecurity research, developments and deployments. Supporting the Cybersecurity Competence Community registration (on platforms such as ATLAS) and contributing to the development of suitable community management tools. read more Expected effects and impacts In addition, this action aims to promote safer digital behaviours, grow talents and attract more youth to cybersecurity careers; the NCCs could also, depending on their national context, carry out one or more of the following tasks: Provide support to innovative ideas towards market-readiness. Promote cybersecurity awareness, best practices, and careers in schools, universities, and community events (for instance by launching a pan-European programme where young individuals will be trained as ambassadors to promote cybersecurity.) Strengthen collaboration between institutions for higher education, e.g. by jointly organising events, by teaching students and working together on cutting-edge research. Support activities in primary and secondary levels of education to increase cybersecurity awareness and hygiene, through educating the teachers and educators. Build stronger partnerships with established SMEs, tech companies, and government agencies to develop and distribute software tools and services that assist in early threat detection, actor identification, and threat evolution monitoring. These collaborations can ensure that cybersecurity professionals have access to the latest tools and technologies for effective threat management. In collaboration with other entities, as needed, organise periodic cybersecurity boot camps, challenges, awareness campaigns and training courses across Europe, specifically for SMEs or students (e.g. focusing on equipping participants with hands on skills to manage prevalent cyber threats through training sessions, workshops, and simulation activities tailored to their industry). Organise periodic awareness raising campaigns, at national and regional level, to increase cybersecurity awareness and hygiene aimed at different demographics. Organise national and regional cyber exercises to enhance the security and resilience of critical sectors as well as SMEs. Foster a community of cybersecurity professionals who can share their experiences, challenges, and solutions. Support and encourage the uptake of cybersecurity educational policy goals in national (cybersecurity) strategies. Promote safer digital behaviours and more youth considering cybersecurity careers. The action could also aim to: Support the adoption of market-ready innovative cybersecurity solutions, including solutions developed in the framework of EU-supported research and innovation projects. Provide and deploy up to date tools and services to organisations (in particular SMEs) to prepare, protect (e.g. network security, advanced two-factor or passwordless authentication) and respond to cybersecurity threats. This topic targets exclusively National Coordination Centres which have been recognised by the Commission as having the capacity to manage funds to achieve the mission and objectives laid down in the Regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres. These actions aim at the operation of National Coordination Centres, which occupy a central role in the cybersecurity landscape as foreseen in Regulation (EU) 2021/887. Due to the synergetic role they play with regard to the activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies, they must be able to handle sensitive information, and be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt undue foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions are subject to Article 12(5) of the DEP Regulation (2021/694). read more Expected results Depending on the decision of each NCC, one or more of the following should be covered: Network of national initiatives to accelerate the cybersecurity industry and facilitate Access-to-Market. European frameworks for establishing cybersecurity incubators and accelerators. Cybersecurity Community Observatory to inform subsequent policy interventions by the ECCC and NCCs. Matchmaking events to create connections and build trust; platforms and events for Access-to-Finance and Access-to-Market including in the area of dual-use technologies Strengthened Cybersecurity Community to support the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre; Maintained technical registration possibilities for candidates for the Cybersecurity Competence Community; Technical assistance for potential applicants for ECCC calls. Uptake of cybersecurity solutions. Strengthened cybersecurity capacities of stakeholders. Synergetic activities that strengthen the role of NCC. Centralise the many initiatives focusing on raising awareness and work together with other NCCs to support a cross European approach covering education, studies, training courses and awareness campaigns; Share and provide best practices related to the awareness topic. Support the transfer of best practices related to cybersecurity teaching for primary and secondary school and other activities for children and youngsters (including camps, materials, games, etc.). Support for teachers and professors to have access to best practices available in the EU and facilitate dialogue. Support the development of cross-over educational solutions for SMEs, for example by gamification. Cyber campaign material focused on young professionals and students of all ages and gender to pursue and advance in cybersecurity careers, where the NCCs can build on in view of regional differences. Cyber campaign material focused on parents and teachers of future students of all ages and gender to raise the number of cybersecurity students. Platform supporting a network of young cybersecurity ambassadors spreading awareness and fostering a culture of cybersecurity among Europe''s youth.

Support and encourage the uptake of cybersecurity educational policy goals in national (cybersecurity) strategies. Promote safer digital behaviours and more youth considering cybersecurity careers. The action could also aim to: Support the adoption of market-ready innovative cybersecurity solutions, including solutions developed in the framework of EU-supported research and innovation projects. Provide and deploy up to date tools and services to organisations (in particular SMEs) to prepare, protect (e.g. network security, advanced two-factor or passwordless authentication) and respond to cybersecurity threats. This topic targets exclusively National Coordination Centres which have been recognised by the Commission as having the capacity to manage funds to achieve the mission and objectives laid down in the Regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres. These actions aim at the operation of National Coordination Centres, which occupy a central role in the cybersecurity landscape as foreseen in Regulation (EU) 2021/887. Due to the synergetic role they play with regard to the activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies, they must be able to handle sensitive information, and be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt undue foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions are subject to Article 12(5) of the DEP Regulation (2021/694). read more Expected results Depending on the decision of each NCC, one or more of the following should be covered: Network of national initiatives to accelerate the cybersecurity industry and facilitate Access-to-Market. European frameworks for establishing cybersecurity incubators and accelerators. Cybersecurity Community Observatory to inform subsequent policy interventions by the ECCC and NCCs.

    'short description This action aims to strengthen the cybersecurity of hospitals and healthcare providers. The goal is to ensure that hospitals and healthcare providers, which are crucial operators in the health sector, can effectively detect, monitor, and respond to cyber threats, particularly ransomware, which pose significant risks, thereby enhancing the resilience of the European healthcare system. The action will contribute to the EU action plan on cybersecurity in hospitals and healthcare, adopted by the Commission in January 2025. Call objectives This action addresses the growing need for continuous cybersecurity monitoring, threat intelligence, and incident response in hospitals and healthcare providers, which often lack dedicated cybersecurity resources to adequately protect themselves from cyber threats. The action will support pilot projects, which will bring together stakeholders such as regional and/or national clusters associations of hospitals and healthcare providers (such as national healthcare systems, hospitals or associations of hospitals, healthcare providers and/or professional associations of healthcare practitioners), as well as cybersecurity service providers. The pilot projects will define the state of preparedness of clusters of hospitals and healthcare providers in the European Union, to be able to assess their needs. Based on this analysis, they will prepare an overview of the state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions and resources needed (technologies, services, tools, human resources, training needs, etc.) for hospitals and healthcare providers to meet the scope of the action. These may include, for example: Security Operation Centres offering real-time monitoring, threat detection, and rapid incident response, and advanced cybersecurity tools, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, threat intelligence, and automated response capabilities, among others. The pilots will develop technical plans, tailored to the needs of representative hospitals and healthcare providers (e.g. small or large hospitals, private healthcare providers, etc.) which will also need to include best implementation recommendations and cost estimates for effective deployment. The pilot projects will conduct a demo implementation of these technical plans to demonstrate their effectiveness in operations at the stakeholders’ sites, showcasing different use cases for different user groups at small, medium and large hospitals and healthcare providers, at least in two different Member States. The pilot projects will serve as demonstration projects and will also provide cybersecurity education and training to the staff of their partner hospitals and healthcare providers, enhancing awareness and ensuring best practices in safeguarding sensitive healthcare information. Finally, in cooperation with each other, the pilot projects will undertake wide dissemination activities of best practices across the EU, with the specific goal of helping replicate and scale up the pilots’ activities as widely as possible. The pilot projects will support healthcare institutions complying with the NIS 2 Directive. read more Expected results Mapping of common cybersecurity needs of hospitals and healthcare providers. Guidelines for healthcare providers to assess their current state of cybersecurity protection and relevant needs.

Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be redistributed accordingly. other eligibility criteriaSubject to restrictions for the protection of European communication networks.',

    'short description The aim of this call is to tackle the challenges of an effective integration of PQC algorithms in Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs), which offers efficient migration strategies and strong business continuity guarantees. The call targets the different actors involved in the PKI ecosystems and supply and value chains, who all have a unique set of diverse needs and interdependencies, such as Certificate Authorities (CAs), intermediate CAs, researchers, end-users in different domains, and vendors. Call objectives Proposals shall target activities on the following subjects: design of digital signature combiners and key encapsulation mechanism combiners. the testing of deployment of certificates in protocols that use those certificates. the development of novel protocols for Automatic Certificate Management and revocation and of novel protocols for (privacy-friendly) certificate-transparency. the development of methods and tools that can be used by experts across various PKI domains, including all aspects of key management of asymmetric systems. Proposals should carefully consider the requirements and constraints, such as security level, performance and business continuity, in a broad range of applications relevant for critical societal sectors and processes (such as governmental services, telecom, banking, smart homes, e-Health, automotive, and other sectors). Proposals should address functions such as key establishment, digital signatures, and secure communication protocols that require careful adaptation with post-quantum counterparts to ensure resilience against threats posed by quantum-capable adversaries. Proposals should safeguard compatibility with existing legacy systems. To achieve this, a transition to PKIs that support both pre-quantum and post-quantum cryptography should be addressed. The proposed systems should be able to seamlessly interact with legacy systems by disabling the post-quantum component as needed while preventing downgrade attacks. Relying solely on PQC solutions in this intermediate transition phase could introduce security risks given that the security analysis of the cryptosystems and of their implementations is not as mature as for their pre-quantum counterparts. Proposals should therefore use combinations of PQC solutions and established pre-quantum solutions, making sure to provide strongest-link security, meaning that the system remains secure as long as at least one of the components of the combination is secure. For certificates for protocols that support negotiation, such as X.509 certificates for the Transport Layer (TLS), the use of post-quantum key exchange has already been demonstrated and can be implemented in a decentralised manner. Many other protocols need to be migrated, and this process will be more complex when old and new configurations must coexist. Moreover, for applications in IoT, smartcards, identity documents and others, the migration strategies defined for the core use cases of X.509 may well not work. Proposals should develop clear procedures to effectively guide the various stakeholders involved in PKIs across different usage domains through the transition process. Effective consortia should comprise a diverse range of actors along the entire PKI chain, encompassing expertise in areas such as software development, hardware implementation, cryptographic research, standardisation, policy, and application deployment, as well as organisations that can provide user case studies and real-world applications. read more Expected effects and impacts Activities should include some or all of the following: Identification of requirements necessary to implement hybrid certificates. Development of approaches and techniques for constructing cryptographic combiners for different protocols. Testing of the combiners for issuance of new certificates for the different applications, taking into consideration the need to balance the growth of key, signature, and ciphertext sizes, which can lead to compatibility issues with standards, such as PKI certificates, revocation mechanisms, (privacy-friendly) certificate transparency mechanisms, the use of different cryptographic protocols across certificate chains, the applications requirements, such as security level, time-constraints in signing and verification steps, communication/computational and storage overhead, and hardware optimisation requirements. Development of and/or further improvement of open-source libraries. Development of novel protocols for Automatic Certificate Management and revocation, and of novel protocols for (privacy-friendly) certificate-transparency. Support to standardisation activities. Development of recipes for the design and deployment of the new PKIs, with analysis that depends on each component of a given PKI. • Tests on specialised uses of X.509 certificates other than the core cases using TLS, such as roots of trust, device integrity, firmware signing, and others. Design, improvement and testing of X.509 alternatives, such as, among others, Merkle tree ladders, the GNU Name System, older proposals such as SPKI and SDSI and the use of key encapsulation mechanisms for on-demand authentication in place of signatures. Awareness and training activities for stakeholders with different profiles, emphasising the interdependencies in the transition and facilitating a broader understanding of the technical standards amongst PKI users. Participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, this topic is subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694. read more Expected results New combiners ensuring that cryptographic schemes provide at least 128-bit security against quantum adversaries. Experimental evaluation on hybrid certificates in several standard protocols that use those certificates, also considering options for different cryptographic algorithms at the root Certification Authority level and at the other levels, in terms of security, performance, and backward compatibility. The impact of such certificates in protocols should be tested via open-source libraries. New and/or improved open-source libraries for certificate requests, issuance, validation, revocation and (privacy-friendly) certificate transparency. Clear procedures taking into account all aspects of key management: requirements for signature generation, in terms of the software and hardware used to create signatures as well as the secure storage and handling of private keys to maintain their authenticity and confidentiality, signature validation, with specification of the data required for verifying signatures and outlining the conditions necessary for a successful signature verification process, signature life-cycle process, and validity status of signatures. Test and evaluation of uses of X.509 certificates other than their core uses. Tests and evaluation of alternatives to X.509 certificates. Awareness activities and training courses.
