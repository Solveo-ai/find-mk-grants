      'short description The overall objective is to ensure the full transposition of the acquis communautaire and its progressive implementation by well-structured and trained administration aiming to secure a high level of public health, animal health, animal welfare and plant health at the national and EU level. Call objectives The specific objective of this call is to support negotiation process, further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy within relevant competent authorities of the Republic of Serbia for Chapter 12: Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, Ministry of Health etc.). In 2013, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and the Republic of Serbia entered into force. Article 1, Section2 (d) of the SAA states that the aim of the Association established is "to support the efforts of Serbia to develop its economic and international cooperation, including through the approximation of its legislation to that of the Community". Working with MS partner/s will assist the Republic of Serbia in further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy and in enhancing economic integration with the European Union’s single market. The international project experts will assist the administrative structures in the Republic of Serbia in charge of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy in meeting opening and closing benchmarks and in meeting conditions within Chapter 12. Furthermore, Title VI-Approximation of law, law enforcement and competition rules, Article 72, Section 1 of the SAA states "the Parties recognize the importance of the approximation of the existing legislation in Serbia to that of the Community and of its effective implementation. Serbia shall endeavour to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation will be gradually made compatible with the Community acquis. Serbia shall ensure that existing and future legislation will be properly implemented and enforced". With respect to aforementioned, one of the mandatory results of the project will be implementation of Law on Official Controls supported through trainings, legislation guidelines, etc. intended for inspection services (Agricultural, Veterinary and 5 Phytosanitary Inspection (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management) and Sanitary Inspection (Ministry of Health)). The national Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development 2014-2024 was adopted by the Government of the Republic of Serbia in 2014 and in Section 3.3.3. Activities on the implementation of strategic objectives, this document reports "the first steps towards establishing and improving existing institutions, organizations and other entities have been taken. A large number of laws and regulations have been adopted, but their effective implementation is still in most areas, at early stages. Further harmonization will be based on EU legislation (acquis communautaire), along with the continued training of administration, entrepreneurs, farmers and all other stakeholders in the implementation of this very demanding legislation". For instance, the implementation of the Animal Health Law will be accomplished through trainings, legislation, guidelines, etc. envisaged within the project and intended for inspection services, veterinary service and laboratories. The same document states improving the quality and safety of products as one of the priority areas (page 76). It says "Improving the system and capacity in the area of food safety and quality entails creating an environment in which all relevant stakeholders in the production chain (public authorities and organisations, food industry, academia and consumers) adhere to the standards of the Codex alimentarius, taking responsibility and ensuring the safety and quality of food." The Progress Report 2024 (Commission Staff Working Document) from October 2024, under Section 5. Ability to assume the obligations of membership, Cluster 5: Resources, Agriculture and Cohesion, Chapter 12: Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy states that: Serbia is moderately prepared in the area of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy. No progress was made during the reporting period. The Commission’s recommendations from last year were not implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular: adopt framework legislation on food safety, official controls, animal welfare and genetically modified organisms, aligned with the EU acquis; strengthen administrative capacity to ensure correct implementation; adopt and start implementation of the national plan to align legislation with EU quality standards for raw milk; prioritise the process of upgrading food establishments to be in line with the EU acquis. The above listed documents apparently show that there is a necessity for further alignment with EU acquis in food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy, as well as a need for further adjustment of relevant institutional capacities necessary to reduce resulting gaps and fulfil needs and obligations originating from these documents and from negotiation process. read more Expected results Component 1: Strategic and legislative framework of the Republic of Serbia supported in meeting conditions within Chapter 12: Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy Result 1.1.

      'short description The overall objective is to ensure the full transposition of the acquis communautaire and its progressive implementation by well-structured and trained administration aiming to secure a high level of public health, animal health, animal welfare and plant health at the national and EU level. Call objectives The specific objective of this call is to support negotiation process, further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy within relevant competent authorities of the Republic of Serbia for Chapter 12: Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, Ministry of Health etc.). In 2013, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and the Republic of Serbia entered into force. Article 1, Section2 (d) of the SAA states that the aim of the Association established is "to support the efforts of Serbia to develop its economic and international cooperation, including through the approximation of its legislation to that of the Community". Working with MS partner/s will assist the Republic of Serbia in further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy and in enhancing economic integration with the European Union’s single market. The international project experts will assist the administrative structures in the Republic of Serbia in charge of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy in meeting opening and closing benchmarks and in meeting conditions within Chapter 12. Furthermore, Title VI-Approximation of law, law enforcement and competition rules, Article 72, Section 1 of the SAA states "the Parties recognize the importance of the approximation of the existing legislation in Serbia to that of the Community and of its effective implementation. Serbia shall endeavour to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation will be gradually made compatible with the Community acquis. Serbia shall ensure that existing and future legislation will be properly implemented and enforced". With respect to aforementioned, one of the mandatory results of the project will be implementation of Law on Official Controls supported through trainings, legislation guidelines, etc. intended for inspection services (Agricultural, Veterinary and 5 Phytosanitary Inspection (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management) and Sanitary Inspection (Ministry of Health)). The national Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development 2014-2024 was adopted by the Government of the Republic of Serbia in 2014 and in Section 3.3.3. Activities on the implementation of strategic objectives, this document reports "the first steps towards establishing and improving existing institutions, organizations and other entities have been taken.
