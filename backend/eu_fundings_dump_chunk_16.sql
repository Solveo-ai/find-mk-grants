      'short description The scope covers quasi-solid and all-solid-state lithium-ion battery technologies (up to 5% liquid electrolyte weight percentage) which encompasses Si-C composite anodes or lithium metal anodes. Call objectives Process-Specific Machinery and Technological Upgrades Projects are expected to identify and target at least one key manufacturing process for enhancement, and to focus on optimising and testing the specific critical process(es) within existing production lines rather than overhauling the entire production system. These processes must be critical to the transition from liquid electrolyte to solid-state batteries and have the potential for high-impact improvements in terms of production yield, quality, cost, and sustainability including energy consumption. Projects are expected to cover all of the following tasks: Provide detailed plans on how existing machinery and systems can be adapted to optimise the chosen process, ensuring that these enhancements are both impactful and economically viable; Modify existing machinery to better support the specialised requirements of the targeted process. This includes enhancing capabilities to handle new materials and designs efficiently; Develop and implement technological innovations that specifically enhance the chosen process, such as precision manufacturing tools and additive manufacturing. Feasibility and Impact Validation Projects are expected to conduct pilot testing to validate the feasibility and benefits of the enhancements on the chosen process. Proposals are expected to include clear metrics for evaluating improvements, such as reductions in energy consumption, increases in production yield, and enhancements in product consistency. Projects are encouraged to evaluate the impact of the new or improved process on other steps in the manufacturing line, including any necessary modifications to adjacent processes, or across other parts of the production line and in different manufacturing environments. Advanced Materials and Cell Design Integration Projects are expected to tailor the design of the produced cell to maximise the benefits of the improved process. This can be done through the development of new advanced materials or through the integration of existing materials to improve the targeted manufacturing process. Digitalisation, Data Integration and Analytics and Process Control Projects are expected to cover at least one of the following tasks: Implement advanced control systems and digital technologies that are specifically designed to optimise the chosen process, improving efficiency, and reducing waste; Develop new process simulation methods, process models and materials chemistry models allowing to virtually assess novel cell designs’ flexible manufacturability at scale for adapted existing plants. In addition, projects are encouraged to leverage data analytics and data-driven approaches (artificial intelligence) to enhance decision-making and process optimisation, focusing on the specific needs and challenges of the targeted process. Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan). Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission''s Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of performing experimental research on battery performance and/or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu).

Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic. A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. other eligibility criteriaSpecific cases: Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding. Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions. Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons. Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act. International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority. Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member. Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible. EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity. Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

      'short description The awarded consortium will be responsible for designing, developing, and implementing an app for truckers, free of charge, where drivers and operators can access detailed information about any point of interest, and provide their feedback. The information generated by the app should also be made available and exploitable by third party systems. The work includes the identification of points of interest in scope, defining main indicators and information needs of truckers, determine functional requirements, development of the app and the supporting systems, testing, deployment and communication. Call objectives 1. Improve Working Conditions for Truck Drivers The app will empower drivers by giving them the means to rate and review rest areas, service stations, and facilities. This feedback loop will help other users identify gaps in quality and accessibility, pushing providers to upgrade their standards improving daily working conditions on the road. 2. Address the Shortage of Drivers By highlighting high-quality, driver-friendly infrastructure and working environments, the app contributes to making the profession more attractive. Transparent information and peer reviews help new and existing drivers be informed and take quality choices, making them more likely to stay or join the industry. 3. Safe and Secure Parking The app will map, and rate parking areas based on security, cleanliness, availability, and amenities. This enables drivers to plan rest stops more confidently and safely. It will also give visibility to decision makers and businesses on where are the main gaps and underserve areas across the whole EU road infrastructure. read more Expected effects and impacts Building a reliable and user-friendly platform to access information and provide feedback on truckers points of interest, will reduce the existing information asymmetries in the market. Truckers will have advance access to reliable, community-driven information about services at points of interest along their route, including ratings and comments on service quality. This information, based on feedback from previous drivers, will guide decisions made by truckers and transport managers at various stages of their operations—whether negotiating contracts, planning routes, or performing a transport operation. By relying on the experiences of others, they will prioritize stops and rest areas that have the highest approval ratings from the wider community. The reputational value of points of interest will drive demand towards the highest-rated locations, while reducing truck stops at those with the lowest ratings. Administrators of these points of interest will have a clear incentive to invest in better infrastructure and service quality to improve their reputation, thereby increasing consumer demand and positively impacting overall business performance. The app will create a virtuous cycle that shifts the market dynamics towards a focus on service quality, significantly improving the working conditions of truck drivers by harnessing their consumer power. Additionally, the app will shed light on undignified situations and poor conditions in which truck drivers are often treated, raising awareness and driving positive change. The app will empower truck drivers by allowing them to share their opinions, report bad practices, and make informed decisions. The app will make each community member, an agent in the push for dignify working conditions within their profession. By fostering a sense of solidarity and accountability, the app will not only improve individual experiences but also drive systemic change. The long-term consequences of this project if it succeed will be far-reaching. It can contribute to a more attractive profession for truckers and increased respect for the vital role they play in the economy. The project will help alleviate the current shortage of drivers, often attributed to poor working conditions and low job satisfaction. As a result, the trucking industry will benefit from improved productivity, reduced turnover rates, and a more skilled and motivated workforce, ultimately leading to a more competitive and resilient transportation network. read more Expected results Activities to be supported under this action shall consist of technical and organisational activities to facilitate the development and deployment of the truckers’ points of interest information and rating app and interoperability services, also known as “Empowering Truckers” app. Activity 1 – Market research, user requirements identification and scoping. Conduct market research: Understanding the nature of the transport and logistic sector and the problem that is intended to be tackled (poor facilities and road infrastructure and quality of services for professional truck drivers). Identifying the landscape of key stakeholders, including professional truck drivers, fleet managers, transport companies and service providers at points of interest (e.g., rest areas, fueling stations, loading and unloading sites). Assessing similar solutions in the market centered around consumer-feedback, evaluating their key features, business model and their overall strengths and gaps. Evaluating other platforms and IT services used by truck drivers to plan, manage or get informed about services on the road (booking parking spots, trip planning, ...) or to conduct their business such as Transport Management Systems or Freight Exchange Platforms. Exploring the landscape of potential partnerships with service providers, industry associations and technology developers that could facilitate and drive the adoption of the app. Conduct focus groups or any other form of stakeholder engagement activities targeting specially the main users of the tool (truck drivers), as well as other users of the tool such as transport managers or points of interest administrators to identify the key user requirements and information needs. Define the business goals, scope, use cases, user requirements and rating metrics of the solution using the results of the market research and stakeholders'' engagement activities. Define the key metrics for the evaluation of the project. Activity 2 – App design and conceptualisation Define the app''s functional requirements: Define the app''s primary features and capabilities, identifying the app’s core functionalities. Outline user journeys and describe user cases. Determine technical requirements and architecture in accordance with performance and security needs: app speed, reliability, offline capabilities and scalability, data governance and user authentication and authorization policies. Create wireframes and first prototypes of the app, laying out the structure and flow of the app, sketching the app’s user interface, defining the structure of each screen and the key interactive elements. Test and validate first concepts iterating and refining the initial design, based on stakeholder''s feedback. In view of the second pre-financing payment up to 20% of the total price, a progress report is required covering the work completed under Activity 1 and 2. Activity 3 – App development Design the visual elements and user experience (UI/UX) of the app, focusing on usability, accessibility, and aesthetics creating an intuitive and engaging interface for users. Develop the front-end of the app, focusing on the design, functionality, and interaction. Develop the back-end server infrastructure, databases, and functions that will support the app’s functionality and store user data. Develop the web service or API that will enable third-party applications to access and utilize the data within the app, providing a seamless way to integrate app information into external systems. Allow external developers to fetch data such as user reviews, service ratings, and location details, enriching their own applications and expanding the app''s ecosystem. Activity 4 – App testing and piloting Test the app thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. This stage includes functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) as well as the integration with third parties. Pilot the app by releasing it to a small group of external users for real-world testing and feedback. Introduce the necessary adjustments to the app, with the insights and lessons obtained during the beta phase. In view of the third pre-financing payment up to 20% of the total price, a progress report is required covering the work completed under Activity 3 and 4.

      'short description The awarded consortium will be responsible for designing, developing, and implementing an app for truckers, free of charge, where drivers and operators can access detailed information about any point of interest, and provide their feedback. The information generated by the app should also be made available and exploitable by third party systems. The work includes the identification of points of interest in scope, defining main indicators and information needs of truckers, determine functional requirements, development of the app and the supporting systems, testing, deployment and communication. Call objectives 1. Improve Working Conditions for Truck Drivers The app will empower drivers by giving them the means to rate and review rest areas, service stations, and facilities. This feedback loop will help other users identify gaps in quality and accessibility, pushing providers to upgrade their standards improving daily working conditions on the road. 2. Address the Shortage of Drivers By highlighting high-quality, driver-friendly infrastructure and working environments, the app contributes to making the profession more attractive. Transparent information and peer reviews help new and existing drivers be informed and take quality choices, making them more likely to stay or join the industry. 3. Safe and Secure Parking The app will map, and rate parking areas based on security, cleanliness, availability, and amenities. This enables drivers to plan rest stops more confidently and safely. It will also give visibility to decision makers and businesses on where are the main gaps and underserve areas across the whole EU road infrastructure. read more Expected effects and impacts Building a reliable and user-friendly platform to access information and provide feedback on truckers points of interest, will reduce the existing information asymmetries in the market. Truckers will have advance access to reliable, community-driven information about services at points of interest along their route, including ratings and comments on service quality. This information, based on feedback from previous drivers, will guide decisions made by truckers and transport managers at various stages of their operations—whether negotiating contracts, planning routes, or performing a transport operation. By relying on the experiences of others, they will prioritize stops and rest areas that have the highest approval ratings from the wider community. The reputational value of points of interest will drive demand towards the highest-rated locations, while reducing truck stops at those with the lowest ratings. Administrators of these points of interest will have a clear incentive to invest in better infrastructure and service quality to improve their reputation, thereby increasing consumer demand and positively impacting overall business performance. The app will create a virtuous cycle that shifts the market dynamics towards a focus on service quality, significantly improving the working conditions of truck drivers by harnessing their consumer power. Additionally, the app will shed light on undignified situations and poor conditions in which truck drivers are often treated, raising awareness and driving positive change. The app will empower truck drivers by allowing them to share their opinions, report bad practices, and make informed decisions. The app will make each community member, an agent in the push for dignify working conditions within their profession. By fostering a sense of solidarity and accountability, the app will not only improve individual experiences but also drive systemic change. The long-term consequences of this project if it succeed will be far-reaching. It can contribute to a more attractive profession for truckers and increased respect for the vital role they play in the economy. The project will help alleviate the current shortage of drivers, often attributed to poor working conditions and low job satisfaction. As a result, the trucking industry will benefit from improved productivity, reduced turnover rates, and a more skilled and motivated workforce, ultimately leading to a more competitive and resilient transportation network. read more Expected results Activities to be supported under this action shall consist of technical and organisational activities to facilitate the development and deployment of the truckers’ points of interest information and rating app and interoperability services, also known as “Empowering Truckers” app. Activity 1 – Market research, user requirements identification and scoping. Conduct market research: Understanding the nature of the transport and logistic sector and the problem that is intended to be tackled (poor facilities and road infrastructure and quality of services for professional truck drivers). Identifying the landscape of key stakeholders, including professional truck drivers, fleet managers, transport companies and service providers at points of interest (e.g., rest areas, fueling stations, loading and unloading sites). Assessing similar solutions in the market centered around consumer-feedback, evaluating their key features, business model and their overall strengths and gaps. Evaluating other platforms and IT services used by truck drivers to plan, manage or get informed about services on the road (booking parking spots, trip planning, ...) or to conduct their business such as Transport Management Systems or Freight Exchange Platforms. Exploring the landscape of potential partnerships with service providers, industry associations and technology developers that could facilitate and drive the adoption of the app. Conduct focus groups or any other form of stakeholder engagement activities targeting specially the main users of the tool (truck drivers), as well as other users of the tool such as transport managers or points of interest administrators to identify the key user requirements and information needs. Define the business goals, scope, use cases, user requirements and rating metrics of the solution using the results of the market research and stakeholders'' engagement activities. Define the key metrics for the evaluation of the project. Activity 2 – App design and conceptualisation Define the app''s functional requirements: Define the app''s primary features and capabilities, identifying the app’s core functionalities. Outline user journeys and describe user cases. Determine technical requirements and architecture in accordance with performance and security needs: app speed, reliability, offline capabilities and scalability, data governance and user authentication and authorization policies. Create wireframes and first prototypes of the app, laying out the structure and flow of the app, sketching the app’s user interface, defining the structure of each screen and the key interactive elements. Test and validate first concepts iterating and refining the initial design, based on stakeholder''s feedback. In view of the second pre-financing payment up to 20% of the total price, a progress report is required covering the work completed under Activity 1 and 2. Activity 3 – App development Design the visual elements and user experience (UI/UX) of the app, focusing on usability, accessibility, and aesthetics creating an intuitive and engaging interface for users. Develop the front-end of the app, focusing on the design, functionality, and interaction. Develop the back-end server infrastructure, databases, and functions that will support the app’s functionality and store user data. Develop the web service or API that will enable third-party applications to access and utilize the data within the app, providing a seamless way to integrate app information into external systems. Allow external developers to fetch data such as user reviews, service ratings, and location details, enriching their own applications and expanding the app''s ecosystem. Activity 4 – App testing and piloting Test the app thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. This stage includes functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) as well as the integration with third parties. Pilot the app by releasing it to a small group of external users for real-world testing and feedback. Introduce the necessary adjustments to the app, with the insights and lessons obtained during the beta phase. In view of the third pre-financing payment up to 20% of the total price, a progress report is required covering the work completed under Activity 3 and 4. Activity 5 – Launch and promotion Deploy the app in app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store) for public download. Implement and execute a marketing and adoption strategy. Monitor the app performance and provide maintenance and support. Evaluate the project performance using the metrics defined in Activity 1. Activity 6 – Governance and strategy a.
