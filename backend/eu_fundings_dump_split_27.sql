    'short description The objective of this action is to support the organisation of not-for-profit, Union-wide highlevel science-policy-society conferences that bring together all interested parties such as citizens, patients, practitioners, scientists, policy makers from local, regional, and Union level. The conferences will cover important health topics that are related to the Union’s health priorities, and thereby contribute to the development and implementation of the European Health Union. Call objectives These conferences are an opportunity for discussion on how to work better together at Union level on one or more health-related topics and will allow Member States, third countries associated to the EU4Health Programme and relevant stakeholders to exchange information and good practices on relevant topics in the field of public health. Grants may be awarded to support the organisation of conferences that correspond to the objectives and the priorities of the EU4Health Programme, and which have a Union-wide dimension. Expected results The conferences should include high level speakers, and a representative number of participants from all relevant fields of the challenges to be discussed. The action will support communication activities addressed to the general public and/or to specific groups of people or health professionals, in order to promote the European Health Union and its different initiatives. Conferences must have a Union-wide dimension. The conferences will not focus on a specific condition or disease however, they will focus on current cross-cutting Union policy issues.',

    'short description The Programme welcomes project applications that align with the objectives of Priority 2 “Green, resilient and sustainable development”, which focuses on two Specific Objectives – 1) adaptation to climate change, and 2) protection of nature, biodiversity and green infrastructure. Call objectives The following priorities and specific objectives were developed as part of the program: P2: Green, resilient and sustainable development SO 2.1: Promoting climate change adaptation and risk prevention and resilience taking into account ecosystem-based approaches SO 2.2: Enhancing protection and preservation of nature, biodiversity and green infrastructure, including in urban areas, and reducing all forms of pollution Expected results The program proposes the following (non-exhaustive list) measures: P2: Green, resilient and sustainable development SO 2.1: Promoting climate change adaptation and risk prevention and resilience taking into account ecosystem-based approaches Activities related to the joint management solutions of cross-border natural sites promoting adaptation to climate change and disaster risk prevention, resilience. They should be based on ecosystem-based approaches and address the following climate change risks – extreme weather risks, drought risks, fluvial and coastal flooding risks, sand and sediment accumulation, forest fire risks, coastal erosion and the spread of invasive alien species and diseases. Activities related to flood protection and prevention infrastructure (nature-based solutions, including flood plains, ecosystem restoration, afforestation, natural water retention measures and other green (or blue) infrastructure measures. These measures must have a direct benefit for climate change adaptation and risk prevention.
