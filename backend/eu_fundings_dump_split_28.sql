    'short description The Interreg Deutschland-Danmark program promotes cross-border cooperation between Germany and Denmark and supports the growth of the region in the areas of business, employment, education, tourism and culture by funding innovative cross-border projects that aim to bring about positive change in German-Danish cooperation. No further applications can be submitted for Priority 3 "An attractive region". The priority is closed and the funds have been exhausted. Call objectives The following priorities and specific objectives were developed as part of the program: P1: An innovative region SO 1.1: Development and expansion of research and innovation capacities and the introduction of advanced technologies P2: A green region SO 2.1: Development of smart energy systems, grids and storage systems outside the trans-European energy network (TEN-E) SO 2.2: Promoting climate change adaptation and disaster prevention and resilience, taking into account ecosystem-based approaches SO 2.3: Promoting the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy P4: A functional region SO 4.1: Improving the efficiency of public administration bodies by promoting their legal and administrative cooperation and cooperation between citizens on the one hand and institutions on the other, with the aim of removing legal and other barriers in border regions SO 4.2: Creating mutual trust, especially through incentives for people-to-people activities You can find an overview of the specific measures and the extent to which they have already been fulfilled or not fulfilled here in the traffic light overview. This should give you a good overview of the areas in which it may be particularly worthwhile to develop an application. read more Expected results The following measures are proposed in the program (non-exhaustive list): P1: An innovative region - A detailed list of eligible measures can be found here. SO 1.1: Development and expansion of research and innovation capacities and the introduction of advanced technologies The specific objective aims to make further contributions to strengthening R&D activities, growth and even better use of research results in the program region through targeted innovations. Furthermore, the competencies and strengths as well as the (existing) innovation and research capacities are to be used increasingly across borders and thus more efficiently and synergies are to be developed. The concept of innovation is understood broadly: it can involve product and process innovations as well as social innovations. An application-oriented approach (with the involvement of companies) is important here - especially for research activities; basic research is not funded in the Interreg program. Thematically, the priority is also largely open, although there is a particular focus on the common strength positions of the program area: Maritime economy Life science and welfare technologies Food industry Digital economy Robotics and automation The only exceptions are the topics of energy, climate change and circular economy, as these - including the respective innovation, development and implementation process - are covered in the priority "A green region". P2: A green region - A detailed list of eligible measures can be found here. SO 2.1: Development of smart energy systems, grids and storage systems outside the trans-European energy network (TEN-E) This specific objective supports projects that contribute to the development and establishment of intelligent energy systems, grids and storage systems in order to ensure a stable energy supply in the program region in the future. A pioneering role in the field of renewable energies has already been developed in the German-Danish program region. The program partners pursue similar objectives with regard to reducing CO2 emissions and the use of fossil fuels, and there is a common interest in promoting renewable energies. Fossil fuels are to be increasingly replaced by renewable energies not only in the electricity sector, but also in the heating, cooling and transport sectors. In addition, the German-Danish region has developed a leading international role in the field of power electronics in recent years. This must be maintained and expanded. SO 2.2: Promoting adaptation to climate change and disaster prevention and resilience, taking into account ecosystem-based approaches Within this specific objective, joint cross-border and needs-oriented solutions for the challenges of climate change are to be developed at and for the regional and municipal level in order to develop the German-Danish region into a climate-resilient region. To this end, specific regional needs and barriers to adaptation to climate change are to be jointly identified, solutions developed and recommendations for policy-makers and regional and local administrations derived. This also includes raising political awareness of this issue and measures to provide citizens with well-founded information about climate change and its effects on the program region. However, the overall approach of the program can only be to promote "soft" cooperation, which can nevertheless serve as preparatory measures for investment and infrastructure projects. SO 2.3: Promoting the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy Although the program region is a technologically highly developed area compared to other European regions, economic production with regard to waste prevention is not yet satisfactory and does not provide a sufficient starting point for a green transition. Therefore, there is a need in cross-border cooperation to find new joint solutions, both within the individual value chains and at a higher level, i.e. in planning and within the system. In this specific objective, cross-border solutions as well as models and demonstrations are therefore to be developed in order to design planning and product design in such a way that materials and resources can be kept in the cycle for as long as possible, or to identify materials and resources to prevent waste production from the outset. All solutions should have a positive impact on value creation and competitiveness and reduce waste volumes in the long term. The program''s approach includes all economic sectors. P4: A functional region - A detailed list of eligible measures can be found here. SO 4.1: Improving the efficiency of public administration bodies by promoting their cooperation in the fields of law and administration and cooperation between citizens on the one hand and institutions on the other, with the aim of removing legal and other obstacles in border regions Cross-border cooperation in the programme region is characterized by a large number of stakeholders who cooperate with each other at different levels, in different thematic areas and at different levels. However, the further anchoring of many well-established cooperations could still be significantly improved, for example through corresponding commitment and implementation in the institutions'' own strategies as well as the provision of resources. Overall, cooperation in some areas is not yet sufficiently developed and great potential for cross-border added value remains untapped. In addition, there are further obstacles to closer cooperation, particularly at a legal or administrative level, which influence or even prevent cooperation. In this specific objective, established topics are therefore to be further developed and new topics identified in order to extend strategic German-Danish cooperation to other topics that are distinct from the pure implementation of the Interreg program. These topics also include the (further) development of a joint labor market. SO 4.2: Creating mutual trust, especially through incentives for people-to-people activities An important framework condition for cross-border cooperation and cohesion in the German-Danish area is mutual trust as well as understanding and recognition of each other''s culture, language, values and attitudes. Trust between citizens on both sides of the border can only grow through concrete experiences. Therefore, this specific objective should contribute to strengthening mutual trust between the citizens of the program region. This must be achieved in particular through initiatives that promote international understanding and strengthen intercultural understanding among citizens. This means, among other things, that citizens'' knowledge of German and Danish lifestyles, culture and shared history is expanded across the border. This also includes improving the conditions for learning Danish and German. The expectation is that citizen encounters will create an ever greater public awareness of the importance of intercultural differences and their potential to make the program region special. read more',

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Mandatory partnershipYes Project PartnershipThe minimum requirement for projects is to have two project partners from the Programme Area from two different Member States. The Programme strongly emphasises that projects involving project partners from the Programme area from only two Member States are not the prime target and can be funded only in exceptional and well justified cases. Cooperation of project partners from the Programme area from at least three different Member States are supported by the Programme foremost. As a general rule, the size and the composition of the partnership shall correspond to the planned project activities, therefore the number of project partners in individual projects may differ from the recommended project size. The minimum requirement sets the smallest partnership, but it is strongly recommended to involve relevant partners from the whole Programme area to demonstrate its authentic cross-border nature. Based on previous experience, the recommended partnership size is 6–8 partners in a regular project. In each project, one partner should be introduced with a leading role representing the whole partnership, and act as a lead partner. Cross-border cooperation among different organisations is the core of the South Baltic Programme.
