    'short description EIT Urban Mobility invites innovators from across Europe to submit a proposal to its Strategic Innovation Open Call, designed to accelerate the deployment of impactful solutions that address the most pressing challenges in urban mobility. Call objectives The call focuses on supporting ambitious, market-critical projects that tackle clearly defined problems faced by cities, public authorities, and mobility providers. We aim to de-risk development and enable large-scale deployment by backing solutions with a clear path to market and the potential to scale across Europe. Through this call, EIT Urban Mobility fosters innovation and strengthens Europe’s competitiveness by encouraging collaboration across the EIT Knowledge Triangle—education, research, and business—alongside a fourth essential partner: cities. The Call will focus on five sectors in which we believe Europe has the potential to innovate and create impact: Urban logistics, Public transport, Mobility data management, Electrification of transport and alternative fuels, and Health and mobility. In the future, the Call may also include specific topic scopes to address key market opportunities or urgent market failures that can be addressed through our funding. read more Expected effects and impacts At EIT Urban Mobility we are looking for ambitious collaborative projects that accelerate the adoption of impactful innovation. To support this, we are refining our project frameworks to better accommodate initiatives with greater scale and vision. While we remain flexible in what we fund, a clear focus on commercialisation is a key pre-requisite — projects must demonstrate strong market potential and a credible path to market by the end of implementation. The solution/s should be designed for sale to external clients and replicable beyond the initial use case. Projects with an internal focus — such as those optimising own operations or lacking a clearly marketable product or service — will be considered out of scope. To this end, EIT Urban Mobility is seeking projects that respond to one of the following frameworks: Solution package projects: Projects developing and testing multiple solutions addressing a shared urban mobility challenge across one or multiple demonstration sites. The focus is on creating a cohort of scalable solutions for commercialisation rather than investing in a single, complex solution. Value chain projects: These projects unite key players across the value chain, ensuring all essential roles are integrated to make an innovation viable. Solutions (products, services, new business models or operational approaches) should address well-identified critical inefficiencies in industrial value chains or public-sector-driven challenges. Single solution projects: Projects supporting high-impact solutions that require longer times and budget for extended development, validation, and regulatory approvals to reach full market readiness. To ensure strategic fit, all projects must demonstrate market criticality and propose a convincing path to market. We seek initiatives that address clearly defined urban mobility challenges aligned with policy priorities and pressing market or customer needs. At the same time, projects must go beyond prototyping and testing to cover essential steps such as certification, scalability, intellectual property protection, and preparation for commercialisation within the project timeframe. read more Expected results The Call will focus on five sectors in which we believe Europe has the potential to innovate and create impact: Urban logistics Solutions (products, services and business models) that reduce the negative externalities of urban logistics – such as congestion, emissions and noise – while enhancing efficiency, resilience, sustainability and integration with the urban environment, especially in last-mile operations. Innovative concepts for logistics hubs and digitally enabled solutions that foster greater collaboration among logistics operators, cities and users are particularly encouraged. Public transport Solutions that strengthen public transport as the backbone of a resilient, sustainable, inclusive and multimodal mobility ecosystem, by improving its attractiveness and competitiveness – with the clear goal of attracting users away from private cars. New concepts, technologies and business models that enhance demand-responsive transport and integrate shared mobility services with public transit –aimed at improving first- and last-mile connectivity and expanding overall network coverage are encouraged. Mobility data management Data-driven solutions that enhance the performance, efficiency and responsiveness of urban mobility systems through e.g. the use of advanced analytics, AI, quantum technology or real time data – in alignment with EU-level interoperability and data governance efforts (e.g. common data spaces, European data standards, open digital infrastructures). Solutions that enable cities and public authorities to make data-informed decisions – particularly for the design and implementation of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs), inclusive/participatory planning and citizen engagement, resilience and disruption response, or regulatory monitoring and enforcement (e.g. Low Emission Zones) – are particularly encouraged. All solutions should adhere to principles of data privacy, interoperability, replicability and scalability, while demonstrating a clear pathway to sustainable deployment and uptake. Electrification of transport and alternative fuels Solutions that advance zero-emission urban mobility through innovation across the electrification value chain, vehicles, new battery technologies, smart /dynamic charging infrastructure, grid integration or life battery extension, reuse and recycle. Alternative fuels solutions such as hydrogen applications, that support early adoption, reducing initial or operative costs, offer integrated solutions to the urban environment, and are viable to scale-up. Health and mobility Solutions that promote active mobility as a foundation for healthier urban lifestyles, by improving safety, convenience, inclusivity and integration within the urban environment, facilitating a modal shift towards active modes. Proposals should go beyond typical behavioural change campaigns, to include innovative and market-oriented solutions that strengthen the European cycling industry and align with the goals of the European Declaration on Cycling. Digital or public space design innovations must demonstrate a disruptive approach and clear potential for adoption by public authorities. This topic also includes innovations that monitor, reduce, or mitigate the health impacts of air and noise pollution in urban mobility systems – including solutions for cleaner transport, reduced exposure, and health-informed planning. read more',

    'short description This priority supports holistic and intersectional responses to discrimination and intolerance - in particular on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, colour and religion - as well as to racism and xenophobia, antigypsyism intolerance, including their manifestations on the ground. Such responses should aim to build trust between individuals, communities and national authorities. Call objectives The priority will support projects that help to effectively implement: the EU Anti-racism action plan, which aims to combat structural forms of racism faced in particular by people of colour and people of African descent, Muslims or people perceived as such, Roma as well as people of Asian descent. the Racial Equality Directive (Council Directive 2000/43/EC), which aims to lay down a framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment. the EU Roma strategic framework, which aims to promote effective equality, socio-economic inclusion and meaningful participation of Roma, and the Council Recommendation on Roma equality, inclusion and participation, which aims to have Member States adopt national Roma strategic frameworks; adopt and implement measures to promote equality and effectively prevent and combat discrimination, antigypsyism, social and economic exclusion, the extremely high at-risk-of-poverty rate and material and social deprivation among the Roma population; and step up meaningful participation by and consultation of Roma people. We are looking for projects that focus on: multisectoral cooperation between civil society organisations, public and private organisations and local authorities to address systemic and structural racism in areas related to access to quality housing, employment (i.a. skills, vocational training.) and social inclusion (fight against poverty, etc.). the reporting, rights-awareness, protection, advocacy and interest representation of victims. the diversity of Roma, with a specific focus on the political participation of Roma youth, the health of Roma women, the early childhood development and care of Roma children and environmental justice. The priority does not support research projects. Projects can be either national or transnational. Transnational projects are particularly encouraged. For projects concerning Roma inclusion and participation, national consortia are encouraged. read more Expected effects and impacts Increased knowledge of EU and national non-discrimination legislation; Increased knowledge and application of administrative practices in the non-discrimination field, including practices and policies covering multiple discrimination; Increased rights-awareness as well as awareness of biases and stereotypes; More effective implementation and enforcement of the legislation on non-discrimination, as well as improved independent monitoring and reporting; improved understanding of racism and its different forms, including structural racism as well as increased knowledge on EU policies and legislation; Empowered and increased protection for groups, communities and individuals affected by manifestations of intolerance and racism, with a particular focus on antigypsyism, as well as on anti-black and anti-Asian racism; Improved knowledge and awareness of and capacity to react to all forms of racism among the population in general and key groups in particular such as decision-makers, law enforcement and the judiciary, and young people. Increased knowledge on the recording and the collection of data on incidents, with a view to harmonising the methodologies across the EU. read more Expected results Activities that can be funded: Coalition building, capacity building and training for professionals and victims of (intersectional) discrimination; Mutual learning, exchange of good practices, cooperation, including identifying best practices which may be transferable to other participating countries; Dissemination of information and awareness-raising, including via social media, press campaigns and through engaging with media industry; Data recording, data collection, surveys, monitoring and reporting of incidents of discrimination; Gender- and age-sensitive victim empowerment and support; Contributing to designing and implementing strategies or action plans. Priority will be given to practical projects that develop and implement specific measures and involve the target group. All consortia are encouraged to produce English translations of the main project’s outputs to increase the possibility of best practice exchange and dissemination of the results across the EU. Activities that support specific political parties will not be funded, regardless of their grounds for applying or objectives. All activities should, both at design and implementation stage, incorporate a gender equality perspective. Thus, applicants are expected to conduct and include in their proposal a gender analysis (including non-binary people where applicable), which maps the potential different impact of the project and its activities on people in all their diversity. Applicants should demonstrate that they reflected on the equality dimension of their proposal and address it in a way that is proportionate to their project. Thereby, unintended negative effects of the intervention on any gender should be avoided (dono-harm approach). Applicants are encouraged to consult the key questions listed on the website of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) when conducting their gender analysis. A gender-sensitive approach should include identification of best practices, data collection, including disaggregated statistics, information dissemination and monitoring and evaluation approaches. All activities must avoid discrimination, victimisation and stereotyping. All applicants who need further guidance are advised to consult the EIGE’s materials on gender analysis and DG JUST’s online workshop on gender mainstreaming projects. Where applicable, applicants are advised to complement their gender analysis with an analysis of other grounds of discrimination that can have an impact on project implementation. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate a good understanding of intersectional discrimination when framing target group needs and reflect this in their proposal. Reflections should be proportionate to the project’s scope and context. read more',
