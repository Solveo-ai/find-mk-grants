It is a prerequisite for all HEIs from Erasmus+ Programme countries and Western Balkans third countries not associated to the Programme to apply for funding under Erasmus+ calls (including calls managed by Erasmus+ National Agencies).

By applying for the ECHE, the HEI confirms that its participation in Erasmus+ is part of its strategy for modernisation and internationalisation. This strategy acknowledges the key contribution of student and staff mobility and of participation in transnational cooperation projects, to the quality of its higher education programmes and student experience. The ECHE aims to reinforce the quality of student and staff mobility, as well as of cooperation projects.

The certification procedure consists in validating the status as a ‘higher education institution (HEI)’ and certifying compliance with the ECHE quality standards (Erasmus Policy Statement, quality of organisation and management structures and the implementation of ECHE principles).

The ECHE will be valid for the entire duration of the Erasmus+ Programme 2021-2027 (and up until the end of projects funded under that Programme). The award of the ECHE does not automatically imply any direct funding under the Erasmus+ Programme.

ECHE holders will be subject to regular monitoring by the National Agencies.

    'Europe’s Critical Raw Materials Act (CRM Act) sets ambitious goals for domestic production, processing, and recycling. To achieve these goals by 2030, Europe must:


	Increase domestic mining to supply at least 10% of Europe’s Critical Raw Materials’ needs.
	Expand processing capacity to cover 40% of Europe’s demand.
	Accelerate recycling efforts to reclaim 25% of end-of-life products.


Diversify supply sources to ensure no more than 65% of any material comes from a single external country.

EIT RawMaterials is committed to transform this vision into reality and making raw materials a strategic strength for Europe. We are the sectors’ leading knowledge and innovation community with more than 300 partners comprising the leaders in industry, research and technology, and academia in the raw materials sector. EIT RawMaterials has successfully deployed over EUR 600M in strategic funding under the Horizon Europe programme, unlocking secondary funding into research, innovation, upscaling, skills and raw materials projects of more than EUR 3.6B.

The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA), led by EIT RawMaterials, has grown to over 750 members with an overall investment potential of EUR 50B and the potential to close the EU raw materials’ supply-demand gap by between 20-100% across a range of Critical and Strategic Raw Materials.

All organisations that are eligible for funding under the Horizon Europe programme can apply.

You do not have to be an existing partner organisation of EIT RawMaterials to apply for funding, but by becoming one, you will gain access to a valuable source of expertise and potential collaborators. They will work with you and help build your consortium if, or when, you decide to apply for funding.

We also encourage our partners and stakeholders from industry, research, and education, including start-ups and SMEs, to submit new project proposals. These projects should demonstrate how they will impact significantly on European industrial competitiveness, innovation capacity, and human capital, as well as empower students and entrepreneurs advancing the circular economy and the green and digital transition goals of the European Green Deal.

The project Consortium must consist of a minimum of two Project participants, coming from a minimum of two different countries eligible for Horizon Europe funding, and a maximum of 5 Project participants. No more than 80% of the grant can go to one of the partner.

The lead Project participant must be a Core or Associate Partner (or Linked Third Party to a Core or Associate Partner) of EIT RawMaterials by the time the project starts.

The project Consortium must include Project participants from at least two sides of the knowledge triangle (education, research, industry/business - as defined in the Partner registration documentation). All EIT RawMaterials’ policies, including on diversity and inclusion, apply.

Project participants that are non-members are eligible to apply as Members only if they submit an EIT RawMaterials membership application before the project starts. Failure to apply for EIT RawMaterials membership will result in their removal (including the requested funding) from the proposal (note that the project will be immediately terminated if eligibility criteria are not met at this stage).',

The basic rule in the program is that at least one Polish and one German partner always participate in the project - both with ERDF funds.

Normally, all project partners are based in the participating regions of the program area. In justified exceptional cases, project partners based outside the program area can also participate in an Interreg project. The decisive prerequisite is that the project-related activities of the partner are carried out for the program area, achieve a visible added value for it and are essential for the implementation of the project. Project partners can be both public and private organizations.

The project partners must nominate a lead partner. Only public organizations may assume this function in the program.

The project partners must cooperate on the following two levels within the framework of the project:


	Joint preparation: regular meetings or coordination on project development, joint development of project content, objectives and scheduling, joint preparation of project documents.
	Joint implementation: activities of all project partners coordinated in terms of content and timing, joint project coordination, each project partner takes on at least one sub-task.


In addition, the partners must cooperate on at least one of the following levels:


	Joint personnel: one or more project partners provide additional personnel or release existing personnel to carry out project tasks in the interests of all project partners.
	Joint financing: joint cost and financing plan of the project partners, in which each project partner assumes part of its own funds, each project partner pre-finances its share of the costs.

Renovating with modular components and elements that can be dis- and re-assembled and thereby repurposed across different applications further supports the long-term use, adaptation, and repurposing of buildings, common spaces, and infrastructures.

    'The re-assembly stage is key for the re-integration of increasing quantities of reclaimed construction products into new applications. Concurrently, the endeavour to transform the built environment along the New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion, and beauty creates opportunities to re-think how to re-assemble reclaimed construction products safely and creatively in ways that increase the aesthetic and cultural value of buildings and infrastructures, enhancing inhabitants’ well-being and living conditions.

The re-assembly of safe and sustainable reclaimed construction products requires solid knowledge of their historical uses and characteristics as well as traceability of their condition and displacement. Digital tools and technologies such as Digital Product Passports and reverse construction supply chains, following the circular economy’s cascading principle for bio-based materials and 10R-Strategies (refuse, reduce, resell/reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, recover, re-mine) for non-biobased materials, are key for the effective management, movement and reuse of safe reclaimed construction products.

Local reverse construction supply chains that re-circulate safe construction products as locally as possible have the potential to maximise economic value and resource utilisation, reduce waste, pollution, energy use, procurement costs, and the environmental footprint of construction and renovation activities, and foster creativity and innovation towards greater circularity and the regeneration of social and cultural meanings in the built environment.

    'Call objectivesSocial connections and cultural participation are core features of individual well-being. Evidence shows a strong association between participation in cultural activities and civic behaviour (such as voting and volunteering), empathy, tolerance, security and social cohesion. Conversely, low interpersonal trust, heightened risk-taking, and disengaged civic attitudes are correlated with an increased sense of loneliness – the lack of meaningful social interactions. Cultural organisations and artistic practices with a social purpose or dimension can help to better connect people, strengthen social fabric, and overcome social boundaries.',

Furthermore, the attention to aesthetic values in the design of street furniture can contribute to local economies by attracting new visitors (e.g. developing creative tourism) and supporting local businesses, cultural and creative sectors and industries, and social economy entities and enterprises.

More prototyping and demonstration are essential to speed up the integration of innovative street furniture, that offer more attractive, sustainable, and inclusive design solutions for common spaces, following the values and principles of the New European Bauhaus.',

    'Call objectivesProject platforms are Interreg Baltic Sea Region’s main capitalisation tool. They enable project partners to consolidate the outcomes of Interreg Baltic Sea Region projects, and integrate them with results from projects of other funding programmes.

Project platforms support public authorities and relevant organisations in using consolidated project results in their work. This is how they help them govern and manage their areas more effectively. This, in turn, allows to tackle territorial challenges and influence policy improvements with greater impact.

By bringing partners from Interreg Baltic Sea Region projects and other EU funded projects together, project platforms are operations of strategic importance (OSI). They provide a significant contribution to the achievement of the Programme objectives under Priority 1 Innovative societies, Priority 2 Water-smart societies, and Priority 3 Climate-neutral societies.',

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)',
    'Mandatory partnershipYes',
    'Project PartnershipThe partnership of a project platform should be strategically crafted, involving project partners with comprehensive knowledge of their projects’ outcomes. It should be based on partners from ongoing or recently completed Interreg Baltic Sea Region projects, and involve partners from projects of other funding programmes. Projects can be from the current (2021-2027) or previous (2014-2020) funding periods as long as they provide useful results for capitalisation.

Each partner of a project platform should either represent a project with relevant outcomes or act as a representative of a knowledge multiplier, like EUSBSR policy area coordinators, pan-Baltic organisations, other international organisations, and networks of cities and regions.

Project platform partners must represent at least two different projects from Interreg Baltic Sea Region and at least one project from another funding programme. It is encouraged to adopt a broader approach by involving partners from multiple projects across various funding programmes. This approach enriches the outcomes of a project platform, enhances its value for public authorities and other relevant organisations, and aligns with the strategic importance of project platforms.

The project platform partnership must include at least three project partners from three different countries of the Interreg Baltic Sea Region Programme area: a lead partner and at least two project partners. At least two of the project partners have to be located in the territory of two different EU Member States in the Programme area. Given the strategic relevance of project platforms, applicants are encouraged to build partnerships that ensure a good outreach to relevant organisations in the Interreg Baltic Sea Region Programme area.

As a general rule, organisations located in the regions belonging to the Programme area can become project partners. In exceptional cases, organisations from outside the Programme area can also apply as project partners.

The partnership builds on the lead partner principle, requiring each project platform to designate a lead partner responsible for preparing and submitting the application. The lead partner should be a partner organisation from an Interreg Baltic Sea Region project or an EUSBSR policy area coordinator. Lead partners must fall into the legal status category “public” defined in the Programme Manual (chapter C.2.1).

When involving project partners from other funding programmes, project platforms are encouraged to consider the following programmes: various Interreg programmes (inter alia, Central Baltic, South Baltic, Germany-Denmark, Aurora, Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak, Estonia-Latvia, Latvia-Lithuania, Lithuania-Poland, Sweden-Norway, Northern Periphery and Arctic, North Sea Region, Central Europe, Interreg Europe), as well as other EU funding programmes like Horizon Europe, LIFE, national and regional programmes under the ESF+ and ERDF, and instruments run by regional organisations such as the Council of the Baltic Sea States and the Swedish Institute.

Additionally, project platforms are encouraged to involve other important stakeholders as associated organisations.',

    'Additional InformationLead applicants must complete a project platform idea form (PIF) and submit it to the MA/JS. The PIF should provide a brief overview of the projects to be included in the project platform, and the project platform’s scope, partnership, planned outcomes, and budget. The completed PIF must be sent to the MA/JS any time after the call opens but no later than 30 September 2025. 

The MA/JS will support the development of project platforms by providing feedback in individual consultations on project platform ideas and organising a project platform development workshop. All applicants are required to consult their project platform ideas with the MA/JS.

Whenever possible, the applicant should involve the relevant EUSBSR policy area coordinators in developing the project platform idea. With applicants’ consent, PIFs will be shared with the relevant EUSBSR policy area coordinators (PACs) for feedback from PACs. When feasible, the MA/JS will engage the PACs in consultations with applicants.

PIFs submitted to the MA/JS will be made available to the Monitoring Committee of the Programme. The Monitoring Committee members may contact lead applicants to offer guidance on further developing project platform ideas. The MA/JS will not receive information about the guidance provided by the Monitoring Committee members. It is up to the project platform partnership to consider how to incorporate the advice received.

Information provided in the project platform idea form, including feedback from the MA/JS during the consultation, will not influence the quality assessment of the submitted applications. The MA/JS will conduct the quality assessment solely based on the information from the submitted applications.

To further support applicants, the MA/JS will organise a development workshop for project platforms as a physical event targeting lead applicants, core partners, and PACs. To participate in the event, a potential project platform lead applicant needs to submit a PIF.

To fill in a project platform application form and work with further documents and forms (partner declarations, contact information, bank information), lead applicants, after having submitted a PIF, must apply for access to the electronic data exchange system BAMOS+ (https://baplus.bamos.eu/). Requests for access to BAMOS+ must be submitted by 30 September 2025 at the latest.

The fully developed project application and all further documents and forms must be completed and submitted via BAMOS+ by the deadline of 20 November 2025 16:00 CET.',

Both these initiatives have the goal to make Europe a resource-efficient and competitive economy, while reducing EU reliance on fossil fuels. The EU has set targets to reach climate-neutrality by 2050. This framework can drive competitiveness, as it gives certainty and predictability to companies and investors alike. This will be achieved by nurturing competitive manufacturers who drive decarbonisation through innovation, create quality jobs and contribute to our open strategic autonomy, fully respecting and applying the principle of technological neutrality for Member States as appropriate. This thematic priority intends to support innovative value chain investments, to boost our competitiveness through green technology with a focus on energy-intensive industries and the clean-tech sector as per the Clean Industrial Deal.

It also intends to provide support to interregional investments in resilient and sustainable food systems and agriculture, clean energy, green industry, energy-efficient buildings and renovation, sustainable mobility and eliminating pollution.

This thematic priority encourages applications in one or more or a combination of the following investment areas (non-exhaustive list):


	Innovative investments in decarbonisation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to improve air quality, health and well-being;
	Investments in circularity, including but not limited to the management of natural resources, including the use of recycled materials, especially construction materials, plastics and textiles, to stimulate demand for secondary markets raw materials;
	Innovative business investments related to smart, sustainable/efficient transport solutions and/or alternative fuels;
	Business investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency to make industry more sustainable;
	Business investments related to energy efficiency in buildings;
	Business investments related to a sustainable blue economy, contributing to the coastal protection;
	Business investments in circular economy to replicate and scale up successful circular economy solutions, which can generate EU added value;
	Investments in bioeconomy, efficient and sustainable agriculture and forestry, innovation in marine/ maritime and inland water sustainable solutions.
	Investments in sustainable business models and alternative modes of production and consumption (e.g. leasing, repair, modular design, industrial symbiosis…).
	Innovative investments in SMART cities;


3. Smart manufacturing

This thematic priority focuses on improving the delivery of new or improved products, processes or services in the manufacturing industry and fostering competitiveness, strategic autonomy and a circular economy approach, as outlined in the Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal. In the context of advanced manufacturing; knowledge and innovative technologies are used to produce complex products and improve processes to lower waste, pollution, material consumption and energy use. Robotics, 3D and 4D printing, artificial intelligence as well as high performance computing for modelling are important elements in advanced manufacturing.

This thematic priority supports interregional innovation investments for the uptake of new or improved manufacturing solutions, as well as for supporting industry to face the challenge of digitalisation and to promote the shift towards a more environmentally sustainable production (zero pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment). This thematic priority encourages applications in one or a combination of the following investment areas (a non-exhaustive list):


	Demonstration processes, i.e. helping new industrial products to reach the market faster or having more efficient and sustainable processes adopted by the industry.
	Valorisation of research results and practical applications for innovation diffusion. This might include the active involvement of ecosystems and the co-creation process with stakeholders and end-users.
	Connecting or making complementary use of testing and demonstration facilities at interregional level. In this framework, synergies with circularity hubs are encouraged.
	Improving the use of natural resources and the reuse of materials, promoting circularity models (de- and remanufacturing) and investments in carbon neutrality. Specific implementation (including funding) strategies, ensuring the participation of all stakeholders (industry, SMEs, local authorities, educational institutions and civil society).
	Implementation of interregional demonstration cases to test and replicate the results.
	Innovation diffusion and involvement of SMEs in EU value chains.
	Innovative investments in advanced materials.

Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP)

I3 Instrument projects are implemented by the beneficiaries, in line with the project application. FSTP can be used to enable cascade funding where it offers an added benefit, e.g. in facilitating the involvement of SMEs, fostering replication and innovation diffusion.

However, FSTP is only allowed under the following conditions:


	Based on publication of one or more open call(s) that shall contribute to the objectives of the project, and provide solutions to the needs identified by the SMEs/companies in the project consortium;
	Justified by the needs of the main investors involved in the consortium (addressing specific innovation challenges, exploitation, replication, etc.);
	The maximum amount of financial support for each third party (‘recipient’) may not exceed EUR 60 000;
	The direct recipients of the financial support must be SMEs that are established in EU Member States regions including overseas countries and territories (OCTs);
	The calls must be open, published widely and conform to EU standards concerning transparency, equal treatment, conflict of interest and confidentiality;
	The calls must remain open for at least 2 months;
	The outcome of the call(s) must be published on the beneficiaries’ websites, including a description of the selected projects, award dates, project durations, and final recipient legal names and countries;
	The costs for Financial Support to Third Parties (i.e. SMEs) cannot exceed 30% of the total eligible costs.
	Financial Support to Third Parties can only aim at supporting SMEs able to provide an added value to the project, e.g. to complete a specific value chain and/or to offer a specific groundwork for testing and optimising products and production processes, or for the exploration of new processing technologies.


If the proposal includes Financial Support to Third Parties, it must specify why financial support to third parties is needed and how it will be managed. It also has to include estimates of the proportions of financial support allocated to third parties across various types of regions. The proposal must also describe the results to be obtained and the expected effects on the innovation ecosystems of the participating regions.

Specific requirements


	At least 70% of the total direct eligible costs must be allocated to investments in companies, with a focus on SMEs. The proposal shall describe how this requirement will be met, specifying the total eligible costs for:

	
		SME consortium partners (beneficiaries and affiliated entities)
		Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP)
		non-financial support provided to the SMEs of the portfolio.
	
	
	At least 50% of the total eligible costs shall be incurred in less developed regions by beneficiaries and 3rd parties if FSTP is included. In case FSTP is used, the proposal shall describe how this requirement will be met.


Proposals have to demonstrate a comprehensive strategy for ensuring active participation of legal entities from less developed/transition/outermost regions, alongside specific measures for enhancing their active involvement and contribution to the consortium''s objectives. This should include plans for replication of results in participating regions and engagement of relevant regional authorities for sustainable impact.',

Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows:


	at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
	at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries.



Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic.

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality.


Specific cases:


	Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
	Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions.
	Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons.
	Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
	International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
	Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
	Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.
	EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
	Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.

    'In Ukraine, mine action is a critical aspect of the humanitarian emergency response, the goal of which is to support the return of the civilian population and the rebuilding of crucial civilian infrastructure. As part of their mine action operations, EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, such as Croatia, Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Armenia also strive to make their land completely free of anti-personnel mines and other explosive ordnance.

Humanitarian demining is not to be confused with military demining, which is the process undertaken by soldiers to clear a safe path so they can advance during conflict.

Various humanitarian demining initiatives have been developed, which often incur high costs and are typically slow because no mistakes are allowed. In addition, due to a large diversity of contaminated areas, types of anti-personnel mines and of their deployment methods, as well as a more complex contamination that includes unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices, there is no single solution to the problem. Finally, new anti-personnel mines are being developed and new mine deployment techniques being used. Therefore, new, improved, innovative or disruptive solutions, accompanied by related training curricula, are needed to enhance humanitarian demining activities in civil areas. Since the aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security, it has to be complemented by an adequate risk education, raising awareness of civilians of the risks from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance, which will help them act in such a way that will reduce the risk to people and the environment. A range of risk education initiatives exist, but they usually lack, among others, collaboration with related Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), sustainability, and a comprehensive needs assessment aiming to improve their effectiveness. Within this topic, improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners are expected, which are adapted to regional and cross-border contexts.

	the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions
	the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States
	countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries



Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows:


	at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
	at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries.



Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic.

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality.


Specific cases:


	Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
	Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions.
	Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons.
	Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
	International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
	Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
	Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.
	EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
	Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
	With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity.

    'Responders need to exchange information (language, data, video, etc.) in a reliable, secure, and universal way, while emergency communications throughout the European Union also need to be strengthened. In many instances, interoperability of tools, technologies and communication channels is still an open issue, requiring standard operating procedures, specific education, training and exercises of responders.

The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to testing / validate tools, technologies and data used in cross-border prevention, preparedness and responses to climate / geological / accidental fire disasters and chemical, biological or radiological emergency threats (including medical countermeasures) by different practitioner’s sectors in view of demonstrating their interoperability in real-case situations, with focus on the use of AI and ML tools, miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification, and communication (including cross-border emergency communications).

Proposals are expected to address one of the following options focused on testing / validation of tools and technologies, and demonstration of their interoperability:


	Option a: Use of artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) tools to support first responder’s analysis, planning and decision-making;
	Option b: Miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification;
	Option c: Information exchange / Communication among first responders in a reliable, secure and universal way, and cross-border emergency communications;
	Option d: Alert system to detect CBRN threats, integrating different systems at national, regional and European levels.


Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.

    'The EU-funded security research ecosystem has changed the traditional relationship between practitioners and solution providers. The awareness of security needs and solutions has been steadily growing at all levels during the last years, with EU funded security research and innovation projects playing a pivotal role. This awareness guarantees not only that research addresses critical needs, but also that the research investment will deliver tangible results.

There are several approaches to achieve a better market uptake and to ensure that innovation can pass from the realm of research to the realm of the market and eventually innovative tools to be used by security practitioners.

In order to support SMEs and start-ups but also practitioners to find the avenues of uptake of innovation, models and methods for transferring research to the market should be promoted. This topic aims to offer services and guidance to entities in the security ecosystem to achieve market uptake.

The services should be delivered to SMEs/Start-ups and Practitioners. Therefore, there would be Supply-oriented Services and Demand-oriented services.

Some of the expected services could be open for the whole community (e.g., material online) and examples of good practices, whereas others would be provided upon specific request by an entity (on demand services). On demand services may be linked to other EU-funded actions but should not cover activities already funded from those in order to avoid double funding.

Applicants should be able to demonstrate a proven experience in technology development and innovation in the area of security and deep knowledge on the security ecosystem.

Successful candidates should be able to provide services such as:


	Funding & procurement guidance
	Market research / competitive landscaping / Marketplaces / Market surveys/consultations
	Proof of concept development (for TRL 2-4)
	Funding and tendering observatory
	Investor search / venture building
	Technology validation support Lab testing support (i.e., Readiness assessment, Artificial Intelligence act compliance, Machine Learning security, Ethical Legal and Societal assessment, High Performance Computing capabilities, Synthetic data generation, Access to Datasets, stress testing etc.)
	Tech and/or entrepreneurial skills development (training)

    'Project PartnershipTo be eligible for funding, applicants must be established in one of the following countries:


	the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions
	the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States
	countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries



Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows:


	at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
	at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries.



Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic.

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality.


Specific cases:


	Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
	Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions.
	Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons.
	Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
	International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
	Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
	Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.
	EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
	Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
	With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity.
	Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

The EBCG Capability Roadmap recognises that future surveillance capabilities that help detect cross-border irregularities and cases requiring Search and Rescue activities are essential. Solutions should be modular and scalable to cater to the regional and challenges specificities.

Examples of technologies and solutions that may be relevant for this topic include but are not limited to: sensing (at tactical, operational, and/or strategic levels), autonomous platforms, vehicles and systems (aerial, ground, surface or underwater, vessel-based or not, mobile or land-borne, etc); interconnectivity between sensors and platforms and automated data fusion; data processing systems; image and signal processing and analysis; robotics; computing technologies including edge and cloud computing; decision-support systems and human-machine interfaces.

Projects should integrate:


	perspectives of safeguarding and promoting human rights, including gender equality, developing solutions that contribute to those safeguarding and promotion;
	inputs from human rights, law and ethical perspectives, as well as the consideration and views of individuals and society, as well as a gender sensitive approach, as appropriate; proposals can engage with civil society organisations for wider input and support;
	aspects of cybersecurity of the technology proposed, and the protection of communication systems and networks involved in the solutions, if and as relevant.

	the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions
	the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States
	countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries



Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows:


	at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
	at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries.



Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic.

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality.


Specific cases:


	Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
	Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions.
	Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons.
	Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
	International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
	Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
	Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.
	EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
	Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
	With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity.
	Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'Strengthening societal resilience to disasters requires investment by authorities at operational, strategic, and policy levels to improve engagement with citizens and integrate inclusive communication processes. In order to achieve this, it is important to take into account the diversity of citizens, be it relating to age, gender, educational levels, disability, and other social characteristics.

The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The EU’s disaster resilience goal No. 2 is “Prepare – Increasing risk awareness and preparedness of the population. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting these two policies and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Proposals are invited to utilise the Special Eurobarometer on “Disaster risk awareness and preparedness of the EU population" as evidence of needs.

Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions and technology, including the use of AI, for improving disaster preparedness, risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities, and for reinforcing the cooperation among scientific / technical communities and policy-makers / regional and/or local authorities for an enhanced sharing of knowledge and uptake of research outputs. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.

Proposals are expected to address one of the following options:


	Option a: Tools and solutions to improve disaster preparedness and risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities;
	Option b: Mechanism to enhance dialogue among research/academic communities, practitioners and regional and/or local authorities for sharing knowledge and effectively uptake research results.


Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised.

If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
	Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.
	EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
	Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
	With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity.
	Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'In the security domain, due to its specificities, the special categories of data involved or/and unique limitations, which may call for additional requirements, a consolidated, common research database is particularly desired. It is of utmost importance that security practitioners are provided with an increased interoperability and improved (cross-border) exchange of data thanks to harmonised data file formats across Europe, which would easily take into account technological evolutions, i.e., be adaptable in time. Such a lack of realistic, up-to-date and sufficient training and testing data for research purposes and consequently the need for a database, data repository or any other effective and useful tool(s) to gather, manage and store varying security research data, have been regularly raised by the projects working in the area of security. The same is true of data on disaster risk management where national or regional analysis and forecasting databases or national disaster risk assessments can be fragmented or sealed without reasonable open, sustainable access to the wider community.

As a follow up of the outcomes and results of the LAGO project coming from the 2021 data topic: HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-04: Improved access to fighting crime and terrorism research data, the successful proposal, should subsequently focus on creation and deployment of a fully functional and operational common research data repository, which will extend to cover other security research areas.

The LAGO project is currently developing the skeleton of how such a repository of R&I data should be created, by providing a detailed roadmap consisting of a clear set of rules, conditions and characteristics that such a consolidated database should have. This LAGO roadmap will provide technical, legal and ethical requirements for a training and testing research data repository mostly in the area of fighting crime and terrorism, but the same project will already take into account possible applications of identified solutions in different security research domains, such as infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience. The LAGO roadmap will also assess if the repository should be centralised or distributed, how to deal with "aging" data, how efficiently projects should exchange data among them taking into account security R&I specificities.

Building on the skeleton of LAGO, the newly developed data repository will enable security community (researchers, practitioners, industry, policy makers) access the scientifically satisfactory amount of up-to-date high quality and realistic data which is or was used to develop reliable (mostly digital and based on AI but also non-digital and not linked with big data) tools, technologies and solutions in support of security research and innovation. This data repository could also be very useful for verification and validation of new innovative security solutions developed under various calls in the most recent Work Programme.

Taking into account the complexity of the future repository, a multi-faceted approach will be needed and the proposal, apart from the roadmap’s findings developed by LAGO, should also build on, and not duplicate, LAGO’s outcomes regarding the following aspects:


	What exact types of data should be stored in the repository;
	Interoperability with existing operational systems;
	Interoperability/compatibility with European open science cloud (EOSC), with the TESSERA project as well as other potentially relevant architectures and initiatives such as European Data Spaces or GAIA-X;
	How to search for data;
	Data models for security research - Harmonising of data formats;
	Concept of operations for the use of the repository by/during EU-funded security R&I projects, modalities of use, user profiles/schemes, etc.
	Legal issues, avoidance of any bias, accessibility levels related to the sensitivity of various data sets, solutions for annotation as well as for the aging of the data, etc.

Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows:


	at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
	at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries.



Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic.

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality.


Specific cases:


	Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
	Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions.
	Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons.
	Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
	International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
	Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text.

    'Europe’s 25 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy. SMEs can bring innovation to societal challenges, including the security of EU citizens. Innovative SMEs and high-tech start-ups can transform and modernise EU security capabilities.

However, despite the innovation capacity of EU SMEs, these often experience difficulties in finding their way to the public markets. These include red tape in public contracts, access to

new customers, access to finance, industrial competition and IP valorisation. These difficulties are exacerbated in markets that show restrictions of different kind, as it is the case of security.

Knowing that SMEs require additional support to reach the security buyers and that the collaboration opportunities offered by the projects of the Pillar II of Horizon Europe can be a catalyst for uptake, this topic aims to offer a collaborative environment for small and medium innovators to tailor their innovations to the specific needs of civil security end-users.

Applicants are invited to submit proposals for technology development along with the following principles:


	Focus on mature digital technological solutions aligned with STEP guidance addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 Work Programme;
	Fostering collaboration between SMEs from different Member States and Associated Countries;
	Involving security end-users in the role of validator and potential first-adopter of the proposed innovations;
	Fostering collaboration schemes between small companies and research and technology organisations and/or big industrial players aimed at fostering innovative technology transfer or creating innovative business models that facilitate access to market and strengthen the innovation capacity of EU SMEs and start-ups in the domain of civil security.


Examples of activities to plan in the proposed projects include, but are not limited to: assimilating market requirements; facilitating access to additional funding; approaching potential public buyers; assess competitive landscape; supporting in innovation management (methodological and process innovation, business model innovation, market innovation); assist in IP management and exploitation; provide guidance for expansion to future markets, etc.

The participation of research and technology organisations should not focus on own technology development but on supporting the small industrial players in accelerating the technology transfer of innovative security solutions for their further development and production.

It is encouraged that one SME takes the coordinator role. Exceptions to this requirement should be duly justified.

This topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) and addresses civil security technologies falling under the sectors of “Digital technologies and deep-tech innovation. This topic contributes to the objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, i.e., to boost investment in critical technologies in Europe, and, to contribute to reducing or preventing the strategic dependencies of the Union.

	the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions
	the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States
	countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries



Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows:


	at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
	at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries.



Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic.

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality.


Specific cases:


	Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
	Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions.
	Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons.
	Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
	International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
	Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
	Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.
	EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
	Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
	With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity.
	Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users.

Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions for an enhanced understanding of impacts of disasters and crises linked to natural or human-made causes on risk governance and improved resilience of emergency systems, that are not covered by topics of Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2023-2024. If they related to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.

Proposals are expected to address one of the following options:


	Option a: Enhanced impact forecasting and early warning systems, understanding of climate / weather extreme events and geohazards and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention and preparedness;
	Option b: Enhanced impact forecasting and understanding of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive (CBRN-E) threats and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention preparedness and response (including medical countermeasures). Projects do not need to address all elements of CBRN-E.


Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.

    'In light of the ongoing conflicts and the complex, high-risk environments they present, this topic focuses on developing and deploying advanced autonomous systems specifically tailored for large-scale, multi-dimensional disasters and tailored to the challenges of conflict driven. These disasters, exacerbated by geopolitical conflict, severe infrastructure damage, and immediate safety threats to both civilians and responders, demand innovative and resilient solutions. The topic seeks to address the EU’s critical need for tools that protect infrastructure, services, and populations while enhancing resilience and operational readiness.

Through rigorous real-world testing and capacity-building programs, responders will be trained to integrate and manage these autonomous systems effectively, preparing them for rapid deployment in high-stakes scenarios. The project will focus on delivering innovative, durable, and efficient technological solutions that allow responding effectively to crises similar in complexity and danger in environments similar to the one of the war in Ukraine. By developing tools that address the unique operational and safety challenges posed by such scenarios, this topic will reinforce the EU’s preparedness to protect both citizens and first responders, ensuring swift, coordinated responses to complex crises across Europe and beyond.

Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular researchers and innovators previously active in Ukraine as well as Ukrainian researchers and innovators who are unable to return to Ukraine in the given circumstances.

	the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions
	the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States
	countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries



Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows:


	at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
	at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries.



Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic.

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality.


Specific cases:


	Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
	Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions.
	Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons.
	Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
	International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
	Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
	Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.
	EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
	Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).

    'Efforts are on the way to include these in core Internet protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). While this is an important development, many more protocols need to be modified to be quantum-ready and to ensure backward compatibility with legacy systems. Various application areas, such as Internet of Things, cloud-based applications, and automotive, place constraints on bandwidth or processing time which may prompt different choices than those employed for TLS. Currently used high-level protocols may have components that are specific to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) or to Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) or may require additional building blocks next to or in place of signatures and key-exchange mechanisms. While applications that provide authenticity are less urgent to migrate than those for confidentiality, those using embedded hardware such as secure elements, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using hardware tokens and others have a very slow turnover and need to be replaced by the time large quantum computers exist, thus requiring migrating the design in the near future.

Activities should target one or multiple relevant high-level protocols and produce their post-quantum versions. Typically, this can be achieved through combining current and post-quantum solutions for backward compatibility. Atypical solutions with equivalent security are also welcome. Consortia composed by actors of different nature, such as, for example, research institutions, relevant public entities, and industry to ensure that PQC solutions meet real-world security demands and are robustly tested across various applications are also welcome.

    'Call objectivesThe development of quantum algorithms demonstrating a significant quantum speed-up would represent a major breakthrough, necessitating a reassessment of the security of cryptosystems (lattice-based, code-based, and others). Conversely, if no significant quantum speed-up is discovered, it would bolster our confidence in the security of these post-quantum cryptosystems, though some parameters may still require fine-tuning. Moreover, up to now existing quantum attackers have been analyzed mostly in a theoretical way. However, their application to nowadays cryptosystems fail due to a lack of efficient implementations and hardware. Studies are also needed on AI-based approaches that may be used to attack certain schemes with certain implementation choices, and the discovery of eventual vulnerabilities can help the research community develop more robust post-quantum cryptosystems.',

Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows:


	at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
	at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries.



Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic.

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality.


Specific cases:


	Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.

    'Generative AI presents both opportunities and challenges in the field of cybersecurity. This topic supports the research on new opportunities brought by Generative AI for Cybersecurity applications, to develop, train and test AI models to scale up detection of threats and vulnerabilities, enhance response time, cope with the large quantities of data involved, and automate process and decision-making support; for example by generating reports from threat intelligence data, suggesting and writing detection rules, threat hunts, and queries for the Security information and event management (SIEM), creating management, audit and compliance reports and reverse engineering malware.

Proposals addressing expected outcome 1 (see below)


	Advanced threat and anomaly detection and analysis: Current cybersecurity tools may struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics of cyber attackers. Developing, training and testing of Generative AI models can be used to analyse large volumes of data and accurately identify anomalies and deviations from normal patterns of behaviour, enabling more effective threat detection, analysis and response.
	Tools should also support cybersecurity professionals as they may struggle to detect and respond to threats posed by generative AI, particularly as these systems become more sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from genuine human activity.
	Adaptive security measures: Cybersecurity tools often rely on static rules and signatures to detect threats, making them less effective against new and evolving attack methods. In addition, many cybersecurity tools still rely on manual intervention for threat response, which can be time-consuming and ineffective. Generative AI, through development, training, finetuning and testing of Generative AI models can support these tools to adapt and respond to emerging threats in real-time, improving overall security posture.
	Enhanced authentication and access control: The use of AI technologies could improve resilience of authentication and access control systems to unauthorized access and credential theft, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information or systems.


Proposals addressing expected outcome 2 (see below)


	Development of tools powered by Generative AI that analyse and facilitate the Application of the national and EU regulation in digital systems, in particular the Artificial Intelligence Act, the Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS2) and the Cyber Resilience Act.
	Adaptation to a dynamic environment. Companies, public sector and organisations face an ever-changing environment which makes keeping up with compliance towards cybersecurity rules challenging. On one hand there’s a variety of rules applicable at sectorial, national or European level to be considered. On the other, change management and updates in ICT systems in organisations is frequent. Addressing both facets with tools powered with Generative AI brings the potential for a compliance continuum within organisations otherwise limited in time when driven by human intervention only.

	the Member States of the European Union, including their outermost regions
	the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) linked to the Member States
	countries associated to Horizon Europe - see list of particpating countries



Only legal entities forming a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a different country as follows:


	at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
	at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member States or Associated Countries.



Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations (including international European research organisations) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic.

A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal personality.


Specific cases:


	Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
	Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions) are allowed, subject to any conditions regarding associated partners set out in the specific call conditions.
	Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons.
	Legal entities created under EU law (EU bodies) including decentralised agencies may be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
	International European research organisations are eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
	Joint Research Centre (JRC)— Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
	Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. However, if the action is in practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible.
	EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) as well as Article 75 TFEU, are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
	Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
	With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity.
	Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506, as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals and can participate without receiving EU funding, as associated partners, if allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.).In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner.

    'Machine-learning methodologies are leveraged to dissect medical and behavioural data, aiming to unearth causations and insights into cyber attacks or threats. However, a substantial portion of this data comprises personal information, (such as sensitive health data), raising concerns over potential breaches or misuse, thus jeopardizing the privacy of individuals, societal well-being, and economic stability.

In addition, the challenges related to the exploitation of non-personal/industrial data assets, which could impede the full realization of the data-driven economy, are also subject to the work that can be proposed under this topic. Solutions that can provide security against quantum adversaries are also encouraged.

Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as cryptographic anonymous credentials, differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, advanced digital signatures, such as ring signatures, blind signatures and attribute-based credentials hold promise in mitigating these challenges, yet their practical application necessitates further refinement and rigorous testing. Consortia are encouraged to propose solutions that can improve the usability and effectiveness of different PETs in realistic environment and to investigate their integration within common European data spaces. The inclusion of agile schemes designed in a modular way to support the transition to post-quantum PETs and the design, improvement and security analysis of quantum-resistant PETs is welcome, in light of the advances of quantum technologies.

    'In various application areas such as IoT, cloud-based applications, automotive, measures to prevent such attacks currently lead to substantial resource overhead due to the complexity of the algorithms, and the security remains unclear given the limited exploration of different attack surfaces. Countermeasures, to the extent that they are available, may have significant impact on run-time and memory consumption. Resistance in PQC implementations to implementation attacks is an increasingly common concern among customers, especially when exploring the right balance between security and performance.

Evaluating the security of PQC algorithm implementations against side-channel and fault attacks is crucial, given the proven vulnerabilities. Various countermeasures, such as masking, shuffling, randomized clocking, random delay insertion, constant weight encoding, code polymorphism, control-flow integrity and re-computation of critical operations can be employed to mitigate these attacks. Synergies between specific countermeasures and the design of cryptographic systems are available for pre-quantum cryptography but require investigation for post-quantum cryptography.

    'This action addresses the growing need for continuous cybersecurity monitoring, threat intelligence, and incident response in hospitals and healthcare providers, which often lack dedicated cybersecurity resources to adequately protect themselves from cyber threats.

The action will support pilot projects, which will bring together stakeholders such as regional and/or national clusters associations of hospitals and healthcare providers (such as national healthcare systems, hospitals or associations of hospitals, healthcare providers and/or professional associations of healthcare practitioners), as well as cybersecurity service providers.

The pilot projects will define the state of preparedness of clusters of hospitals and healthcare providers in the European Union, to be able to assess their needs. Based on this analysis, they will prepare an overview of the state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions and resources needed (technologies, services, tools, human resources, training needs, etc.) for hospitals and healthcare providers to meet the scope of the action. These may include, for example: Security Operation Centres offering real-time monitoring, threat detection, and rapid incident response, and advanced cybersecurity tools, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, threat intelligence, and automated response capabilities, among others.

The pilots will develop technical plans, tailored to the needs of representative hospitals and healthcare providers (e.g. small or large hospitals, private healthcare providers, etc.) which will also need to include best implementation recommendations and cost estimates for effective deployment.

The pilot projects will conduct a demo implementation of these technical plans to demonstrate their effectiveness in operations at the stakeholders’ sites, showcasing different use cases for different user groups at small, medium and large hospitals and healthcare providers, at least in two different Member States.

The pilot projects will serve as demonstration projects and will also provide cybersecurity education and training to the staff of their partner hospitals and healthcare providers, enhancing awareness and ensuring best practices in safeguarding sensitive healthcare information.

Finally, in cooperation with each other, the pilot projects will undertake wide dissemination activities of best practices across the EU, with the specific goal of helping replicate and scale up the pilots’ activities as widely as possible.

The pilot projects will support healthcare institutions complying with the NIS 2 Directive.

    'The objective of this topic is to support the operation of the NCCs and to enable them to support the cybersecurity community, including SMEs, for the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions and strengthen cybersecurity capacities. This could also be achieved by using Financial Support for Third Parties (FSTPs). Based on the financing received in previous years and on the different operational start dates in the Member States, this activity aims to continue providing support for NCCs.

In this regard, it is important to stress that individual NCC can choose from the list of activities and deliverables included in this topic depending on their interest and mandate. There is no obligation for NCCs to execute all actions.

This topic also considers providing support for the uptake of EU cybersecurity technologies and products, commercialisation and scale-up of the European cybersecurity start-up/SME ecosystem, in collaboration and complementarity with the European and ongoing national and regional initiatives, such as accelerator and incubation programmes and technology transfer programmes. Such a strategy should also include support for scale-ups, considering the use of public procurement and private investment.

An essential aspect of this action is to create a framework for the emergence of such incubators and accelerators in the Member States, based on best practices and considering the specific needs and requirements arising from EU legislation (such as the Cyber Resilience Act, NIS 2 Directive).

In addition, this topic could contribute to cybersecurity awareness. It is becoming increasingly important to inform and educate EU citizens on cybersecurity topics in their daily use of digital technologies. Cybersecurity awareness helps individuals and organisations to identify threats and take appropriate action. By promoting awareness, the likelihood of incidents and data breaches can be reduced. Within this topic, NCCs are encouraged to build upon ongoing initiatives, including for example the ones from the EC and ENISA, to improve the awareness of EU citizens, businesses and organisations about cybersecurity risks and threats and to support Europe-wide actions to increase the number of students in cybersecurity courses, students engaged in cybersecurity research activities and students and young professionals choosing a career in cybersecurity.

Furthermore, European companies are innovative and develop highly competitive products, but the still underdeveloped Digital Single Market confines most of these companies (especially SMEs and start-ups) to their home country. A platform that can open the European market for small and medium-sized enterprises would also act as a springboard into international markets. This platform will ensure the competitiveness of European cybersecurity solutions. As such, this topic could also support the EU market’s growth in cybersecurity products and services by providing a platform on which European SMEs and start-ups can post their (market-ready) products and solutions and on which businesses, public authorities and private individuals can search for the best solution for their needs, regardless of the country.

The National Coordination Centre should carry out, depending on their decision, one or more of the following tasks:


	Acting as contact points at the national level for the Cybersecurity Competence Community to support the ECCC in achieving its objectives and missions.
	Providing expertise and actively contributing to the strategic tasks of the ECCC, taking into account relevant national and regional challenges for cybersecurity in different sectors and deliver tasks supporting the implementation of the Cyber skills Academy.
	Promoting, encouraging and facilitating the participation of civil society and industry, in particular start-ups and SMEs, academic and research communities and other actors at Member State level in cross-border projects and cybersecurity actions funded through all relevant Union programmes.
	Providing technical assistance to stakeholders by supporting stakeholders in their application phase for projects managed by the ECCC, and in full compliance with the rules of sound financial management, especially on conflicts of interests. This should be done in close coordination with the relevant NCPs set up by the Member States.
	Seeking to establish synergies with relevant activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies. Where relevant, implementing specific actions for which grants have been awarded by the ECCC, including through the provision of financial support to third parties in accordance with Article 204 of the Financial Regulation under the conditions specified in the grant agreements concerned, in particular aimed at strengthening the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions (notably by SMEs).
	Supporting the scaling-up of start-ups by finding other funding to implement existing projects.
	Promoting and disseminating the relevant outcomes of the work of the Network and the ECCC at national, regional or local level.
	assessing requests for becoming part of the Cybersecurity Competence Community by entities established in the same Member State as the NCC.
	advocating and promoting involvement by relevant entities in the activities arising from the ECCC, the Network of National Coordination Centres, and the Cybersecurity Competence Community, and monitoring, as appropriate, the level of engagement with actions awarded for cybersecurity research, developments and deployments.
	Supporting the Cybersecurity Competence Community registration (on platforms such as ATLAS) and contributing to the development of suitable community management tools.

	the testing of deployment of certificates in protocols that use those certificates.
	the development of novel protocols for Automatic Certificate Management and revocation and of novel protocols for (privacy-friendly) certificate-transparency.
	the development of methods and tools that can be used by experts across various PKI domains, including all aspects of key management of asymmetric systems.


Proposals should carefully consider the requirements and constraints, such as security level, performance and business continuity, in a broad range of applications relevant for critical societal sectors and processes (such as governmental services, telecom, banking, smart homes, e-Health, automotive, and other sectors).

Proposals should address functions such as key establishment, digital signatures, and secure communication protocols that require careful adaptation with post-quantum counterparts to ensure resilience against threats posed by quantum-capable adversaries.

Proposals should safeguard compatibility with existing legacy systems. To achieve this, a transition to PKIs that support both pre-quantum and post-quantum cryptography should be addressed. The proposed systems should be able to seamlessly interact with legacy systems by disabling the post-quantum component as needed while preventing downgrade attacks. Relying solely on PQC solutions in this intermediate transition phase could introduce security risks given that the security analysis of the cryptosystems and of their implementations is not as mature as for their pre-quantum counterparts. Proposals should therefore use combinations of PQC solutions and established pre-quantum solutions, making sure to provide strongest-link security, meaning that the system remains secure as long as at least one of the components of the combination is secure.

For certificates for protocols that support negotiation, such as X.509 certificates for the Transport Layer (TLS), the use of post-quantum key exchange has already been demonstrated and can be implemented in a decentralised manner. Many other protocols need to be migrated, and this process will be more complex when old and new configurations must coexist. Moreover, for applications in IoT, smartcards, identity documents and others, the migration strategies defined for the core use cases of X.509 may well not work.

Proposals should develop clear procedures to effectively guide the various stakeholders involved in PKIs across different usage domains through the transition process.

Effective consortia should comprise a diverse range of actors along the entire PKI chain, encompassing expertise in areas such as software development, hardware implementation, cryptographic research, standardisation, policy, and application deployment, as well as organisations that can provide user case studies and real-world applications.

Through this call, EIT Urban Mobility fosters innovation and strengthens Europe’s competitiveness by encouraging collaboration across the EIT Knowledge Triangle—education, research, and business—alongside a fourth essential partner: cities.

The Call will focus on five sectors in which we believe Europe has the potential to innovate and create impact: 


	Urban logistics,
	Public transport,
	Mobility data management,
	Electrification of transport and alternative fuels, and
	Health and mobility.

The consortium must include all organisations essential to both the successful execution of the project and, importantly, the future commercialisation of the developed solutions at scale - each with a defined role and appropriate budget allocation. This typically includes, but is not limited to: companies aiming to commercialise all proposed solution(s); pilot hosts such as cities, public transport operators, or mobility providers; relevant knowledge or technology providers; or any other entities required to enable market entry, such as certification bodies or regulatory advisors. Importantly, consortia should remain balanced and streamlined, ensuring that the number of partners is appropriate to maintain efficiency, agility, and effective collaboration throughout the project.

Before starting to draft a proposal, all applicants (Project Leader and consortium partners) must follow the following steps:


	Step 1: register your organisation in the EU Funding & tender opportunities portal to obtain the nine-digit Participant Identification Code (PIC number). If you don’t know if your organisation already has a PIC number, you can verify directly on the EU Portal whether your organisation is already registered.
	Step 2:
	
		If you are already registered in the EIT Urban Mobility NetSuite platform (NetSuite) please log in by going to step 3.
		If you have never registered in NetSuite, please complete the Partner Information Form (PIF). If the system denies your registration because the PIC number corresponds to an already registered entity, or because your email address is associated with an existing entity, please contact servicedesk@eiturbanmobility.eu
		EIT Urban Mobility may take up to two working days to process your registration in NetSuite and cannot guarantee last-minute registration requests, especially during peak periods close to the call deadline. Therefore, all project partners are strongly advised to complete their registration several days in advance to ensure successful and timely submission.
	
	
	Step 3: Then, for each proposal, the Project Leader must complete the following step:
	
		access the EIT Urban Mobility NetSuite platform and find under menu --> Call for Proposals --> Open Calls. Submit your application form within the given deadline, including the following supporting documentation:
		
			Pitch deck (PDF or PPT format) (mandatory)
			Latest deposited annual report and latest available profit & loss statement and balance sheet (or other/additional documentation that helps assess a company’s financial standing) from for ALL organisations in the consortium identified as a commercial partner (mandatory)
			Other supporting documents:
			
				Letter of commitment/support (if applicable)
				Freedom to operate study (recommended),
				A link to a one-minute video demonstrating the current technological maturity of the solution (recommended).

Entities which do not have legal personality under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees for the protection of the EU financial interests equivalent to that offered by legal persons.

EU bodies (with the exception of the European Commission Joint Research Centre) can NOT be part of the consortium.

Programme Contact Points are eligible as coordinator or beneficiary in this call, if they have procedures to segregate the project management and the information provision functions and if they are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that their project grants do not cover any costs which are covered by their other grant). This requires the following:


	use of analytical accounting which allows for a cost accounting management with cost allocation keys and cost accounting codes AND application of these keys and codes to identify and separate the costs (i.e. to allocate them to either one of the two grants)
	recording of all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by the two grants (including the indirect costs)
	allocation of the costs in a way that leads to a fair, objective and realistic result.


Entities composed of members may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’. Please note that if the action will be implemented by the members, they should also participate (either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities, otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible).

Beneficiaries from countries with ongoing negotiations for participation in the programme may participate in the call and can sign grants if the negotiations are concluded before grant signature and if the association covers the call (i.e. is retroactive and covers both the part of the programme and the year when the call was launched).

Special rules apply for entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). Such entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).',

    'European Jews have been contributing to the social, political, economic and cultural development of Europe and are an inextricable part of Europe’s identity. Following the 7 October terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israeli society and the war that ensued, antisemitism has risen across Europe and around the world. This escalation has created a climate of everyday “ambient antisemitism”, characterised by growing insecurity, isolation and the erosion of trust within Jewish communities. Today, we are witnessing a troubling rise in Holocaust distortion and the worrying conflation of the Shoah with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. This distortion has a corrosive impact on the resilience of our society and democracy. Antisemitism and polarization pose a threat not only to the Jewish communities but also to the broader European society and undermine democratic values

Priority 2 is split into an open sub-priority and a restricted sub-priority in support of public authorities.

Sub-priority 2.1 – open call:

This open sub-priority will support projects that help to implement the EU Strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life (2021-2030).
We are looking for projects that focus on:


	raising awareness on contemporary antisemitism and its impact on society in general, and on specific target groups such as multipliers (educators, journalists, policy makers) and raising awareness about Jewish life to counter antisemitism;
	improving the monitoring of antisemitic incidents, encouraging reporting and strengthening cooperation with the police at local level;
	strengthening leadership capacities within Jewish communities to counter antisemitism, especially by developing professional networks, thus contributing to fostering Jewish life;
	building bridges between Jewish and other minority groups in the common fight against intolerance and discrimination.


This sub-priority does not support research projects.

Projects can be either national or transnational. Transnational projects are particularly encouraged. We particularly encourage projects to have at least one Jewish civil society organisation, or an organisation specialised in fighting antisemitism, as one of the main partners. Projects led by Jewish civil society organisations are also strongly encouraged. Projects that promote partnerships based on the diversity of and tolerance among different groups and communities are also encouraged.

Sub-priority 2.2 – restricted call in support of public authorities:

This sub-priority aims at supporting public authorities to develop and implement their action plans on combating antisemitism.

We are looking for projects that focus on:


	developing and/or implementing national action plans or strategies on combating antisemitism;
	improving the recording and reporting of antisemitic incidents and harmonising data collection in line with the Vienna Declaration;
	preventing and countering antisemitism, thus fostering Jewish life.


This sub-priority does not support research projects.

    'ODPs will optimise energy use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and reduce the environmental impact, while increasing the benefits enabled by ICT. ODPs will build on and integrate with existing and emerging European data, cloud and edge computing and connectivity infrastructures, in particular those supported in other parts of the CEF Digital programme, the Digital Europe Programme, and the Horizon Europe programme.

The ODPs will contribute to the achievement of EU technological sovereignty and to the security and resilience of energy supply and transports in the EU. This support contributes to the Digital Decade goals such as the deployment of 10,000 climate neutral highly secure edge nodes, etc.




The projects supported by this call are expected to deploy cross-border digital infrastructure implementing an AI-Driven Operational Digital Platform (ODP) for Electricity Consumers and Integration of electric vehicles (EV), electric trucks (ET), renewable energy sources (RES) into the Grid.

Firstly (based on Use case 1 from BEGONIA - ELECTRICITY CUSTOMER CENTRIC ODP), the platform would leverage AI, internet of things and advanced edge computing to bring to the centre of the grid the energy consumers, who are increasingly equipped with digital tools, such as smart meters, app monitoring their rooftop solar panels, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. It would enable them not just to consume, but to contribute to balance supply and demand, trade their flexibility or surplus power, and make informed decisions based on real-time data and AI-driven recommendations.

The platform would create a digital space where households, businesses, aggregators, and energy suppliers interact transparently and in real-time. It would build on existing smart infrastructure, integrates with local energy markets, and respects national and EU regulatory frameworks. It would contribute to consumer empowerment in the energy system while delivering tangible benefits like cost savings, increased renewable usage, and improved grid stability. The platform would be designed to place consumers at the centre of the energy ecosystem by enabling smarter energy management, market participation, and seamless integration with RES. Its deployment is also expected to support grid operators by activating distributed flexibility, thereby reducing peak loads and improving system reliability.

Secondly (based on Use case 2 from BEGONIA - AI-DRIVEN ODP FOR INTEGRATION OF EVS, ETS, RES AND GRID), the AI-driven platform aims to synchronise EV and ET charging with real-time electricity generation, grid capacity, and traffic conditions. It would allow fleet operators to plan charging around both logistics needs and energy constraints, while grid operators could anticipate demand and activate local flexibility, if needed. Additionally, the platform would provide a shared digital layer where energy and mobility actors could interact predictively and securely, for their mutual benefit. The deployment is expected to enable clean transport along key European corridors. It will link public and private charging stations, logistics hubs, and energy market actors, while supporting services that optimise cost, reduce losses, and enhance energy system reliability.

The platform must include the maximum number of the following key functionalities:


	Real-time monitoring and feedback for consumers on energy rate use, carbon footprint, and tariff optimisation;
	AI-based advisory services, helping users to adjust their behaviours or schedules to match renewable availability.
	Participation in virtual energy communities (VECs), allowing local prosumers to trade surplus energy or flexibility;
	Integration of controllable assets such as EV chargers, heat pumps, or batteries to provide demand response;
	AI-powered charging optimisation, based on traffic, weather, grid conditions, and fleet schedules;
	Dynamic pricing and congestion signals, ensuring grid-aware energy consumption and EV charging;
	Smart routing tools for logistics managers, integrating vehicle range, charging station status, and energy prices;
	Integration of renewable generation (e.g. solar, wind) into vehicle charging plans
	Support for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations, where EVs can return energy to the grid during peak demand.


Optional functionalities may include:


	Participation of data centres in flexibility markets, via dynamic load shifting or reserve services;
	Data centres workload migration tools, allowing computing tasks to be routed across borders to greener data centres.


The evaluation of proposals shall prioritise those offering the higher number of functionalities, as they will be considered as having a higher impact. Such impact will be taken into account when evaluating the proposals under the “Impact” award criterion.

The platform should follow a layered digital architecture, for example:


	Perception Layer which connects devices and assets that generate, consume, or store electricity and integrates data from vehicle systems, grid sensors, and weather/traffic APIs;
	Middleware Layer which manages secure and interoperable data exchange across jurisdictions and national and operator-specific systems as well as connects energy markets, building systems, and cloud orchestration software;
	Service Layer that delivers analytics, automation, and local market functionality; offers intelligent charging coordination, predictive energy demand, and fleet management tools; manages optimisation logic, flexibility bids, and load migration;
	Business Layer that supports consumer engagement, regulatory reporting, and value distribution. includes user interfaces for charging point operators (CPO), distribution system operators (DSO), logistics companies, and public authorities. delivers dashboards, sustainability reporting, and regulatory compliance tools.


The proposed ODP should push the boundaries of energy operations by providing private and industrial players with robust digital tools for cross-border trading, monitoring and ownership management. It should be designed to manage European transport in increasingly automated and sustainable way bringing digitalisation and electrification of the sector to a new level. Its strong focus on AI-driven charging and route planning will provide a transport domain benchmarking. By creating transparency and real-time coordination across sectors, the platform is expected to enable more efficient use of both energy and transport infrastructure. The proposed ODP is not only expected to improve the sustainability of a high-impact sector due to increase energy demand because of the new AI tools, but also to open new opportunities for data centre operators to participate in energy markets and contribute to local energy resilience.

The ODP should follow the BEGONIA project’s guidelines related to the architecture, governance and implementation of ODPs, and other preparation materials for delivering the functionalities.

The platform should also ensure GDPR-compliant data governance and align with the Electricity Market Directive, the Data Act, and the AI Act.

    'The specific objective of this call is to support negotiation process, further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy within relevant competent authorities of the Republic of Serbia for Chapter 12: Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, Ministry of Health etc.).

In 2013, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and the Republic of Serbia entered into force. Article 1, Section2 (d) of the SAA states that the aim of the Association established is "to support the efforts of Serbia to develop its economic and international cooperation, including through the approximation of its legislation to that of the Community". Working with MS partner/s will assist the Republic of Serbia in further development of legislative and strategic framework and strengthening of the administrative structures responsible for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy and in enhancing economic integration with the European Union’s single market. The international project experts will assist the administrative structures in the Republic of Serbia in charge of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy in meeting opening and closing benchmarks and in meeting conditions within Chapter 12. Furthermore, Title VI-Approximation of law, law enforcement and competition rules, Article 72, Section 1 of the SAA states "the Parties recognize the importance of the approximation of the existing legislation in Serbia to that of the Community and of its effective implementation. Serbia shall endeavour to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation will be gradually made compatible with the Community acquis. Serbia shall ensure that existing and future legislation will be properly implemented and enforced". With respect to aforementioned, one of the mandatory results of the project will be implementation of Law on Official Controls supported through trainings, legislation guidelines, etc. intended for inspection services (Agricultural, Veterinary and 5 Phytosanitary Inspection (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management) and Sanitary Inspection (Ministry of Health)).

The national Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development 2014-2024 was adopted by the Government of the Republic of Serbia in 2014 and in Section 3.3.3. Activities on the implementation of strategic objectives, this document reports "the first steps towards establishing and improving existing institutions, organizations and other entities have been taken. A large number of laws and regulations have been adopted, but their effective implementation is still in most areas, at early stages. Further harmonization will be based on EU legislation (acquis communautaire), along with the continued training of administration, entrepreneurs, farmers and all other stakeholders in the implementation of this very demanding legislation". For instance, the implementation of the Animal Health Law will be accomplished through trainings, legislation, guidelines, etc. envisaged within the project and intended for inspection services, veterinary service and laboratories. The same document states improving the quality and safety of products as one of the priority areas (page 76). It says "Improving the system and capacity in the area of food safety and quality entails creating an environment in which all relevant stakeholders in the production chain (public authorities and organisations, food industry, academia and consumers) adhere to the standards of the Codex alimentarius, taking responsibility and ensuring the safety and quality of food."

The Progress Report 2024 (Commission Staff Working Document) from October 2024, under Section 5. Ability to assume the obligations of membership, Cluster 5: Resources, Agriculture and Cohesion, Chapter 12: Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy states that: Serbia is moderately prepared in the area of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy. No progress was made during the reporting period. The Commission’s recommendations from last year were not implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular: adopt framework legislation on food safety, official controls, animal welfare and genetically modified organisms, aligned with the EU acquis; strengthen administrative capacity to ensure correct implementation; adopt and start implementation of the national plan to align legislation with EU quality standards for raw milk; prioritise the process of upgrading food establishments to be in line with the EU acquis.

The above listed documents apparently show that there is a necessity for further alignment with EU acquis in food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy, as well as a need for further adjustment of relevant institutional capacities necessary to reduce resulting gaps and fulfil needs and obligations originating from these documents and from negotiation process.

2. Address the Shortage of Drivers

By highlighting high-quality, driver-friendly infrastructure and working environments, the app contributes to making the profession more attractive. Transparent information and peer reviews help new and existing drivers be informed and take quality choices, making them more likely to stay or join the industry.

3. Safe and Secure Parking

The app will map, and rate parking areas based on security, cleanliness, availability, and amenities. This enables drivers to plan rest stops more confidently and safely. It will also give visibility to decision makers and businesses on where are the main gaps and underserve areas across the whole EU road infrastructure.

    'Process-Specific Machinery and Technological Upgrades

Projects are expected to identify and target at least one key manufacturing process for enhancement, and to focus on optimising and testing the specific critical process(es) within existing production lines rather than overhauling the entire production system. These processes must be critical to the transition from liquid electrolyte to solid-state batteries and have the potential for high-impact improvements in terms of production yield, quality, cost, and sustainability including energy consumption.

Projects are expected to cover all of the following tasks:


	Provide detailed plans on how existing machinery and systems can be adapted to optimise the chosen process, ensuring that these enhancements are both impactful and economically viable;
	Modify existing machinery to better support the specialised requirements of the targeted process. This includes enhancing capabilities to handle new materials and designs efficiently;
	Develop and implement technological innovations that specifically enhance the chosen process, such as precision manufacturing tools and additive manufacturing.


Feasibility and Impact Validation

Projects are expected to conduct pilot testing to validate the feasibility and benefits of the enhancements on the chosen process. Proposals are expected to include clear metrics for evaluating improvements, such as reductions in energy consumption, increases in production yield, and enhancements in product consistency.

Projects are encouraged to evaluate the impact of the new or improved process on other steps in the manufacturing line, including any necessary modifications to adjacent processes, or across other parts of the production line and in different manufacturing environments.

Advanced Materials and Cell Design Integration

Projects are expected to tailor the design of the produced cell to maximise the benefits of the improved process. This can be done through the development of new advanced materials or through the integration of existing materials to improve the targeted manufacturing process.

Digitalisation, Data Integration and Analytics and Process Control

Projects are expected to cover at least one of the following tasks:


	Implement advanced control systems and digital technologies that are specifically designed to optimise the chosen process, improving efficiency, and reducing waste;
	Develop new process simulation methods, process models and materials chemistry models allowing to virtually assess novel cell designs’ flexible manufacturability at scale for adapted existing plants.


In addition, projects are encouraged to leverage data analytics and data-driven approaches (artificial intelligence) to enhance decision-making and process optimisation, focusing on the specific needs and challenges of the targeted process.

Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan).

Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission''s Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of performing experimental research on battery performance and/or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu).

JRC shall assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal).

    'CCAM systems will have to show safe and human-like driving behaviour, so that their decisions and actions can be anticipated easily by all road users, respecting the variety of typical driving behaviour across different countries as well as the need for CCAM systems to respect traffic rules and support road safety.

This will require validated models of explicit and implicit human driving behaviour to design and validate such system behaviour. These models will be needed in closed loop simulations of CCAM systems in mixed traffic to realistically represent the reactions of human drivers in other vehicles to the behaviour of a CCAM system. Models representing human driving behaviour are being developed by the projects i4Driving and BERTHA for selected fields of application, i.e. they will be calibrated for a limited number of scenarios. Bringing together and building upon the results of these projects – in particular a simulation library and an innovative methodology to account for uncertainty from i4Driving and a scalable, probabilistic driver behavioural model from BERTHA, research is needed to extend the fields of application that these projects are addressing with a focus on representing driver behaviour in a multitude of safety-critical scenarios, considering the variation and statistical distribution of human behavioural patterns and the factors influencing such behaviour, including the parallel execution of non-driving related tasks.

To achieve high degrees of robustness and applicability in a wide range of scenarios, detailed calibration and parameterisation is necessary, as driver behaviour depends on factors such as the road infrastructure, vehicle types, traffic conditions and rules, as well as regional influences and driver experiences / demographics, e.g., gender, age and other relevant social variables. Considering the deviation of average from ideal human driving behaviour, proposed actions must also validate the models for their extended fields of application, going well beyond the applications and degrees of validation accomplished by the above-mentioned projects under HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-03. Proposed actions are thus expected to raise the technology readiness of such models to TRL 5. Data for parameterisation and validation should be captured by monitoring real human drivers in driving simulators and/or real traffic considering what is happening inside and outside the vehicle.

The action is expected to analyse the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects and help in designing an efficient, clear, and impactful way of applying a Societal Readiness approach in future EU funded R&I projects with a true interdisciplinary collaboration.

The project selected should address all of the following actions:


	Make a consolidated analysis:
	
		on the way Societal Readiness is considered and integrated in the Descriptions of the Actions of selected pilot-projects in terms of content (e.g., the type of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) guiding questions chosen and related methodology), implementation (e.g., SR related work distribution and partners) and methodology. Assess the level, timing, and quality of interactions between SSH and STEM partners during the proposal preparation.
		of all First reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the way SR consideration unfolds from the Description of the Actions’ methodology, observe how guiding questions are addressed and plan to respond to the concerns identified. Compare the various ‘SR visions’ put forward by each consortium.
		of all Final reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the various projects’ experiences, challenges and lessons learned during the actual implementation of the Societal Readiness activities, looking at the participation and type of external actors in co-design methods, responses to SR guiding questions, possible adjustment of R&I activities.
	
	


Mid-project recommendations based on the two first points are expected in order to give a preliminary sense of directionality for future Societal Readiness projects.


	Analyse the various interdisciplinarity mechanisms (SSH vs. STEM, collaboration with societal stakeholders) across pilot-projects as well as their effectiveness in practice. Identify successful interdisciplinary approaches and less successful ones. Possible evolutions in partners behaviours, or changes in interdisciplinary strategies should be identified. The degree of involvement from partners in SR activities, as well as the way they perceive them (in a positive or negative way) should also be scrutinised. This analysis should result in a publication with concrete tips helping future project partners integrating implementable, efficient, and well-accepted interdisciplinary practices both within consortia and towards external actors.
	Organise annual workshops in physical format to allow all pilot project representatives to meet, interact and exchange experiences periodically. Travel costs for all participants are to be covered by this action.
	Set up a public web platform during the action duration, to provide a direct source of support to future SR users, including examples of SR pathways, do’s and don’ts, tips and tricks specifically tailored to facilitate the use and understanding of the European Commission’s approach on Societal Readiness. A survey submitted beforehand to pilot-projects partners could be envisaged to help in defining those needs. The platform should be updated and completed on a regular basis.
	Eventually provide a set of recommendations to the European Commission taking stock of the work achieved as well as of the recommendations elaborated by pilot-projects in their Final reports on Societal Readiness. Practical improvements of the current Societal Readiness approach should be proposed to overcome identified shortcomings, while at the same time, acknowledging the successful aspects of the current approach. The overall Societal Readiness vision should be kept in mind when providing those recommendations, while aiming at keeping a lowest level of implementation complexity, a highest degree of understandability (including for non-SSH experts) and replicability to various technology maturities and fields of applications, as well as a strong interdisciplinary component.


An analysis of the added value of SR pilot topics compared to SSH-flagged-only-topics within Cluster 5 as well as of other relevant Societal Readiness routes (e.g. at national level) applied to R&I projects in the area of Climate, Energy and/or Mobility should be performed. Successful practices identified may complement recommendations to be provided to the Commission.

Information on e.g. on perceptions, feelings, concerns, past experiences on ways of working that is not translated into projects’ documents should be collected via direct interactions (bilateral discussions with respective project partners).

The action should also initiate similar monitoring activities on Societal Readiness pilot projects funded under future Horizon Europe work programmes, whenever operational phases of this action and new pilot projects overlap.

The proposed action requires the effective contribution of relevant SSH disciplines including the involvement of SSH experts to proficiently support the monitoring and evaluation of Societal Readiness pilot-projects in Cluster 5 work programme 2025.

Where possible, the integration with neighbouring industries and/or communities should be considered for the benefit of energy and resources sharing and efficiency.

The solution should be designed to ensure that the industrial process avoids or has very low GHG and other pollutant emissions, ensures high reliability and safety, and high physical and cyber security. It should be physically demonstrated in an industrial environment and be applicable to a significant share of the total energy demand of the industrial plant. The project should demonstrate through numerical simulations that the physically demonstrated solution can be scaled up to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels.

The project should facilitate the future deployment of the solution in the EU and Associated Countries’ plants in the same industrial sector(s). Already before starting the design phase, the needs of most EU and Associated Countries’ factories in the same industrial sector(s) should be surveyed and analysed in order to design a solution that can be adapted to meet most of them, to identify common components to be optimised/standardised and to issue/disseminate technical and economic guidelines.

Proposals are expected to present a strong business model and sound exploitation strategy for the proposed solution, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

    'The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy (SSMS), which translates this overall transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that such infrastructure should rely on clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, as well as on a modernised grid.

Research in this topic should provide knowledge and technical solutions to a triple challenge: (1) limiting emissions of transport infrastructures; (2) making them more resilient to climate change; and (3) addressing environmental and biodiversity aspects. Projects should cover the entire life cycle of transport infrastructures, covering overall emissions from sourcing of materials, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure.

Proposals should address all of the following aspects:


	Development of new methods and techniques to construct, manage, maintain and repair (including self-repair) transport infrastructures, in order to increase climate resilience and lower emissions;
	Assessment of solutions considering the principles of circularity and taking into account the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) approach;
	Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the solutions considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure and accompanying business plans for their implementation;
	Application of innovative materials (e.g. green asphalt, green cement, carbon sinks) that enable transport infrastructures to become more resilient, more sustainable and emit less pollutants;
	Validation of all the proposed solutions and proofs of concepts is to be carried out in at least two large-scale demonstrations. The demonstrations should cover at least two different transport infrastructure types (e.g., road, rail, waterborne, airport) which are located on at least two different Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. The demonstrations should also cover different environments and phases of the infrastructure life cycle (e.g. design, construction, maintenance, decommissioning);
	Analysis of EU national and international standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure;
	Design of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement methods, contributing to lowering the environmental footprint, resources, and material consumption;
	Demonstration of sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure with nature-based solutions (NBS), minimising the negative effects on the environment, including the degradation of ecosystems, the fragmentation of habitats and the loss of biodiversity.

    'The use of electronic means to exchange regulatory information is also expected to reduce administrative costs for economic operators, to enhance the efficiency of freight transport services and to facilitate green transformation of the logistics sector.

Therefore, given their potential, apart from specific B2A functionalities, eFTI platforms could also serve as an enabler for other universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to achieve digital interconnectivity of logistics systems and platforms including in a business-to-business (B2B) perspective.

The proposals should unlock the potential of eFTI platforms for further functionalities, beyond the scope of Regulation 2020/1056, to new B2B services and applications as well as other B2A uses.

Proposals should refer, as a core principle, to the legislative framework and specific technological solutions provided through Regulation 2020/1056, while duly reflecting the latest technological state of the art for electronic information exchange. Where relevant, and especially in B2B perspective, they should apply and build upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing and exchange in transport, the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF) and the European mobility data space (EMDS).

Outside the scope of this topic is any type of architecture, federation of platforms or similar, as these are already delivered by eFTI and DTLF. Proposals also should not develop functionalities already required in the current scope of the eFTI Regulation. Instead, they are expected to leverage and/or extend functionalities of eFTI platforms that are in operation at the time of the implementation of the project, to ensure the effective implementation of new use cases.

Building on the functionalities, requirements and implementation specifications for eFTI platforms provided for in the eFTI Regulation and its implementing and delegated acts, the proposals should address all of the following aspects:


	Develop technical solutions and tools, at least at the level of operational prototype demonstration (TRL7), for complementary applications and services for electronic B2A information sharing;
	Develop universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to enable electronic B2B information sharing in collaborative logistics processes. The proposed solutions should be implemented with minimal integration effort for industrial stakeholders, for instance through the usage of Artificial Intelligence to facilitate data and information interoperability.
	Develop solutions and tools to facilitate SMEs engagement in the digital freight transport and logistics ecosystem and the adoption of solutions by SMEs.
	Define multiple use cases, services and application of eFTI platforms for B2B and B2A processes duly accounting of relevant existing solutions and projects and identifying specific barriers to interoperability and universal adoption.
	Identify and define relevant data to be added to the existing eFTI common dataset to support the new use cases, services and functionalities; while addressing aspects of data sovereignty, data privacy and cybersecurity, pursuant to the relevant Union legislation;
	Assess and provide recommendations for B2B framework arrangements, including standard data exchange contracts, identification/authentication and authorisation to ensure trusted operations in data sharing and exchange in freight transport and logistics;
	Define and seek synergies with relevant EU frameworks and policies related to the exchange of transport emissions data (such as new Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on CountEmissions EU, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and other relevant Union acts) to facilitate their effective and harmonised implementation, including through the establishment of an open source emissions calculators, as well as the exploitation of data sharing frameworks for carbon reporting between operators in the same supply chain;
	Assess the interdependencies and needs with horizontal Union strategies and legislation such as GDPR, digital identities, data spaces, AI act, Data Governance Act, Cybersecurity Act; identify best practices and provide recommendations for compliance.
	Define and test B2A and B2B solutions and use cases in at least 2 demonstration environments/ecosystems involving platforms and users. B2B use cases should be led by industry stakeholders, in particular shippers and logistics service providers (e.g. freight forwarders, transportation companies). B2A use cases should be developed in cooperation with industry stakeholders, researchers and public administrations, including statistical offices.

    'Digitalisation is not a goal in itself but an important supporting development required to remain competitive and to improve the connectivity to ports, other transport modes and the clients (e.g. to keep the direct costs low and to allow synchromodal solutions). Digital interconnectivity (with logistics systems and other digital platforms for transport) is crucial to increase the modal share of IWT in multimodal logistics chains and to be able to significantly contribute to the modal shift goals as presented in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy.

Proposals are expected to focus on the integration of smart vessels, smart infrastructure, smart data and smart governance in multimodal logistics chains. The proposals should address all of the following aspects:


	Building on the results of previous and on-going Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funded projects, identify, develop and test robust technical and operational solutions and tools (also exploring innovative technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence) to connect physically and digitally IWT to existing land and waterborne multimodal logistics chains for a sustainable, efficient, safe, resilient, automated IWT with a view to synchromodal transport;
	Define and develop key parts of the IWT-related aspects of a common framework for multi-modal data sharing, while enabling compatibility with legacy systems; building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), the European mobility data space (EMDS), the electronic Freight Transport Information regulation; and considering high value datasets, the revised Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Directive and River Information Services (RIS) Directive. Outside of the scope are any type of new platforms or similar; rather, proposals are expected to leverage existing frameworks or platforms to ensure effective use case implementation (e.g. proposed solutions could interface with and be integrated in existing platforms used by shippers, carriers and freight forwarders to connect with multimodal information). Proposals could also identify datasets already available or that could be developed in order to enhance the integration of IWT in multimodal supply chains;
	Define and test applications and use cases, building on the proposed solutions for advanced cooperative Smart Shipping and Smart Logistics, including integration with the physical infrastructure, in at least four demonstration pilots in actual operational environments (minimum at TRL 7). The pilots should focus on better integrating inland waterway transport in the multimodal supply chains, with a focus on cross border applications, on the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital manner, and on efficient and green operations. The pilots should cover different types of goods, different routes and IWT basins (to have better EU geographical coverage), possibly along the Trans-European Transport Network corridors. To ensure a user and governance perspective approach, the pilot cases should be led by industry stakeholders (e.g. freight forwarders, intermodal operators), in cooperation with shippers and public administrations (involvement of public administrations is considered a priority). The impact of increased automation and digitalisation on all stakeholders should be considered as part of the requirements definition and throughout the design life cycle;
	Through the pilots and the application of the proposed solutions, analyse the existing relevant regional/national regulations, identify gaps and legal barriers, and propose recommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU level, as well as input for the standardisation and harmonisation of the smart shipping components to the relevant standardisation bodies (e.g. CESNI, CEN, CENELEC);
	Based on the pilots’ results, assess and quantify, in a comprehensive, structured and substantiated analysis, the environmental, economic and social benefits of smart shipping (including automated vessels and the link to the physical infrastructure), and the effects of increasing the use of IWT in multimodal logistics chains. Develop and propose new business models to incentivise the use of IWT;
	Foster collaboration among key stakeholders, including transport operators, logistics providers, shippers, policymakers, and technology developers, also by implementing communication activities and organising an outreach event displaying the pilots’ results and the demonstrated advantages of integrating IWT in multimodal logistic chains

To overcome these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing are required taking into account the most impactful parameters on ageing, reliability and safety and their dependencies.

Proposals are expected to address Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries and are encouraged to develop techniques and methodologies which are applicable to other forms of electro-mobility as well as stationary applications (including second life).

Proposals are expected to address and demonstrate all the following activities:


	Understand and describe the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters;
	Derive advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the-Loop (XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, thermal and mechanical loads at the same time;
	Combine physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and physical battery testing considering specific applications;
	Develop simplified test strategies reducing the number of tests and their complexity while improving battery safety and reliability. Synergies between different battery chemistries, including next generation battery designs and sizes must be exploited where possible, allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level;
	Research activities are also expected to lead to advanced response strategies for damaged and aged batteries. Furthermore, a contribution to the European safety classification system is expected by developing standards for this safety classification. To this end, proposals are expected to establish contact and exploit complementarities with selected proposals under topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-03 “Safe post-crash management of road Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (2ZERO Partnership)” with regards to monitoring techniques for safety risks, algorithms for defining state of health and remaining useful life.


Activities covering the following aspects are encouraged:


	Development of virtual methods for full system validation using physical sub-system results;
	Development, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell or pack measurement and diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over what is currently available. Definition of performance indicators relating to battery degradation and safety, and development of methods for the validation of digital models.
	Application of AI and generative AI for the definition of the design of experimental and testing strategies to increase the outcome of experimental testing campaigns, in order to accelerate achievement of significant conclusions, and to thus reduce testing time and effort.

    'Emissions in ports stem from other sources, such as port operations (e.g., cargo handling, towing, fuel storage, and bunkering) or even other industrial activities (directly or indirectly linked to transport, e.g., fisheries) taking place within the port area. Additionally, ports are frequently situated near industrial zones, making it crucial to possess an accurate and, where possible, real-time understanding of the types, origins, and intensity of pollutant and noise emissions generated in and around a port area.

The shift from heavy fuel oils to alternative fuels in the context of the regulatory framework set to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal requires further research actions; recent evidence from research and monitoring projects has shown that new fuels being considered and GHG emission-control technologies used on-board vessels may result in emissions of other harmful pollutants that are not sufficiently controlled. In some cases, unexpected side effects of emission abatement may arise which might require regulatory action.

Further to such undesired releases, it is crucial to ensure that vessels comply with regulations in force, in coastal areas, at open sea and in inland waterways. Projects under call LC-MG-1-1-2018 of Horizon 2020 showed that remote measurement of SOx emissions using stationary or mobile techniques can significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of compliance monitoring. It is important to explore whether remote or on-board techniques can be extended to the monitoring of additional pollutants such as CH4, NOx, N2O, NH3, UFP, BC, formaldehyde, PM, as well as the Particle Number (PN), NPAHs and to provide internationally harmonised methods and reporting procedures where such measurements can be used within an enhanced compliance monitoring framework in the future. These methods should also have the potential to be used as evidence for law enforcement to enable independent prosecution of violations. Furthermore, there is a need to develop engine testing procedures that better represent operational patterns in order for the emission values from test cycles to accurately represent real emissions.

Limited surveillance measurements at open seas show a different compliance (lower compliance) behaviour for sulphur emissions compared to measurements in coastal regions. Therefore, it is important to identify risk areas for violations and to establish techniques for monitoring in these areas as well. It is of equally great importance to develop harmonised/standardised monitoring methods that could be used as evidence for sanctions in the future.

Assessment of the real-world performance of emission control, in particular for Tier III vessels, is therefore required to make sure that current NOx regulations achieve and sustain the emission reductions that these regulations are designed for. Further, certification testing should be modified to better address real world conditions. Moreover, potential ammonia slip from urea consumption needs to be identified, and N2O emission levels need to be determined to ensure that GHG reduction efforts are not thwarted.

In addition, no established method for identifying NOx emissions that exceed existing standards under real sailing operation is currently in place. Based on different remote or on-board measurement techniques, harmonised methods, and reporting procedures to identify exceedances of expected emission levels needs to be designed and put in action, at least for informative reasons – as no enforcement of low NOx under real operation is currently in place.

With CH4 being a potent GHG, any uncontrolled releases from LNG powered vessels significantly compromise any lower carbon benefits of the LNG as a fuel. Moreover, although boil-off gas (BOG) should be reliquefied or used on-board, records of BOG release to the atmosphere have been reported. The extent of any remaining current problem needs to be identified and measurements on methane slip from actual vessels need to identify the extent of emissions, considering potential needs for methane emission limits (for the engines as well as for the fuel storage onboard and the bunkering process). The problem with methane slip will also remain with the use of bio-methane as fuel.

New fuels are considered in the effort to decarbonise shipping, with the most prominent being ammonia (NH3), methanol (MeOH) and hydrogen. There is currently limited evidence on new pollution dimensions induced by such fuels, including ultrafine particles of non-carbonaceous origin, N2O and NH3 emissions, NPAH, Formaldehyde PM, NOx, etc. Measurements on actual marine engines and vessels using such fuels need to provide new evidence in the pool of data forming so that early measures are taken before such new fuels become widespread in actual use, in case such new emissions prove to be at a level that constitute health hazards or environmental risks. Zero carbon fuels like NH3 and H2, as well as dual-fuel engines and CO2 capture onboard require different remote measurement methods, since CO2 is no longer a stable and dominant reference gas in the exhaust plume. Alternative options in sensing and calculation method need to be introduced.

Demonstration must be undertaken within a real operational environment. In the collection and analysis of remote as well as static sensing data for the monitoring of emissions and air pollutants, the accuracy of the sensors and the quality and verifiability of the data obtained are of particular importance. Potential risks and problems in data collection and sensor technology, in particular as regards the identification of the source of the pollution, should be analysed in detail. A verifiable methodology is also required for processing and interpreting the data in the next step. Issues such as access to data, data storage and associated security aspects (including the assessment of cyber security of interoperable systems) should be fully considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR.

To address all these highlighted issues, proposals are expected to undertake all the following R&I activities:


	Map high emission activities and demonstrate port, coastal, inland and open sea monitoring techniques for at least NOx, BC, N2O, UFP, NH3, CH4,, PM as well as PN and NMVOC (or any other related pollutants), during normal operation of ships which includes dynamic engine loads of all ship types (including port service vessels) and suitable for zero carbon fuels, dual-fuel engines and carbon capture. All the emission measurements should be integrated through static and remote sensing in order to share data;
	Demonstration of the developed measuring technologies in 6 different TEN-T ports, (of which 3 Core and 3 Comprehensive ports, covering at least three sea basins of the Black, Mediterranean, North Sea, N. Atlantic and Baltic Seas). Out of these 6 ports at least one should be classified as a TEN-T inland-waterway only port according to Annex II of the TEN-T Regulation. At least one of the ports should be situated in a city participating in the Cities Mission and activities should feed into the implementation of the Climate City Contract (CCC), with abatement measures and port-city collaborative governance approaches to match or enhance CCC commitments. The selection of ports should be such as to cover a wide range of emission profiles and take into consideration the complexity of emission sources in order to ensure that the outcome is representative and can be replicated to other ports;
	Identify, differentiate and measure in real time at or near possible sources of emissions (e.g., individual vessel, specific port operations, industrial installations within and very close to the port area) under complex (geographical, layout, mixed space uses and other) conditions and variable weather conditions. The calibration of the measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated;
	Development of a methodology for assessing pollution within the port area including emissions from all transport modes, port operations and industries located in the port area;
	Identify the impact of emissions in ports and nearby cities and propose mitigating measures and plans for municipalities and port authorities, including ports in which municipalities are not directly involved in the management of port authorities and terminals;
	Development of Real-Time Decision Support Systems (RT DSS) for ships, onboard ship operations, ship operators to look into data collected to enable port and maritime authorities to make decisions about rebates;
	Development of harmonised monitoring techniques and an automatic reporting and verification system solution helping shipowners to comply with current and future EU and international regulation as well as public authorities to monitor and control emissions from the data exchanged;
	Harmonise/standardise monitoring techniques and reporting (taking also into consideration the CountEmissions EU rules) with the potential to be used for legal prosecution; develop recommendations for improved certification and testing for real world situations;
	Increase evidence to feed pool of data for regulated and non-regulated pollutants from vessels;
	Identify pollutants from new fuels used for shipping decarbonisation;
	Develop protocol(s) for the measurement of BC, UFP, and PN from vessels;
	Develop engine testing methods to better mimic real-world emissions and propose a vessel grading system methodology with respect to its emissions comparable to EURO classification of road vehicles.

    'The common European mobility data space aims to facilitate mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, including trustworthy AI integration).

Several data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&I initiatives. The FAME project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&I projects. Several CCAM Partnership R&I projects expressed interest in making data available and reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE and SYNERGIES. However, this integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and governed by the Data Space Support Centre. In parallel, the DeployEMDS builds a decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe.

Consequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena and AWARE2ALL have generated valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks.

By establishing robust interfaces, ontologies, and data management architectures, the CCAM research community and industry can effectively utilise and repurpose existing data, thereby reducing costs, and facilitating the development and validation of CCAM solutions, including the creation of digital twins through synthetic data. The enhanced sharing of data across the CCAM stakeholders should also benefit national authorities, and operators in their efforts to collect KPIs to monitor wider impacts of CCAM solutions including on safety, economy, and society.

    'Pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities.

Proposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects:


	Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions;
	Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users;
	Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight;
	Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles;
	Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles;
	Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a draft European regulatory framework on the type-approval of micromobility vehicles or self-certification based on harmonised standards;
	Identify, define and pilot test the following in at least two clearly identified real-life urban environments:
	
		new geometric designs of infrastructure to ensure safe, seamless, and comfortable mobility for pedestrians, cyclists and users of micromobility modes while accounting for the increasing demand, higher operating speeds and weight and size of e-bikes, e-scooters and all types of micromobility devices;
		smart technologies (V2X) to assess their effectiveness in preventing and decreasing conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility modes users and motorised traffic;
		road safety requisites, requirements, rules and/or regulations that could be put in place by local authorities in order to increase the take-up and the safety of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups, by 20% compared to the baseline at the start of the project;
		development of a comprehensive, real-time information platform for cyclists that includes data on route accessibility, signage, and infrastructure conditions.
	
	


Special focus should be paid to supporting the safety of user groups with particular vulnerability including people with disabilities (physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, sensory, etc).

    'Most existing AI computing tasks for automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware.

To encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential. Complementarities with projects funded under Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative.

Edge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are essential in safety-critical situations.

To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:


	For next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and complex AI models. Thus, it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM and AIthena.
	Develop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from projects such as SYNERGIES. The development and demonstration use case should include in-vehicle perception and understanding, such as object detection, segmentation, road surface tracking, sign and signal recognition, etc. Decision making and actuation of countermeasures is to be part of the chain of actions. The approaches for these building blocks and enabling technologies should facilitate a quick uptake in adjacent or following projects;
	Optimisation of the models for edge deployment. This involves adjusting the size and complexity of models to allow it to run on the relevant edge devices and include training and verification approaches. Techniques such as model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can be used to reduce the size of AI models without significant loss in performance. Additionally, over-the-air (OTA) updates can be used to manage and update models across a fleet of devices efficiently;
	Develop tools and approaches for edge-AI model monitoring, to ensure that edge-AI systems continue to operate as expected and ensure resilience to failure conditions or attacks, and monitoring model outputs to ensure they are accurate even as real-life conditions and datasets change.

    'Accurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through:


	Regulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime), Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation), Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU MRV) and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU), and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive);
	Relevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” (COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting & Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions in Transport” (CLEVER);
	Standardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards;
	Regular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport;
	Industry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global logistics sector.


Building on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure that:


	The full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and consistent way;
	Relevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically clarified and closed;
	Any detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU framework;
	New technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in developing datasets and methodologies;
	Relevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information.


The Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services.

In terms of crash prediction modelling artificial intelligence has the potential to identify the underlying risk and the complex relationships between large and diverse datasets which in turn could lead to the identification of crash contributing factors and their interrelations. The identification of these risk factors may then allow predicting safety-critical situations at quantifiable risk levels and guide the proactive implementation of crash avoidance measures, as proposed amongst others by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ideally, interventions would be feasible in real-time and increase the safety of all road users.

Proposals should address all the following aspects:


	Development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin of traffic and infrastructure. This would integrate historical, current, and forecast data, including crowdsourcing and infrastructure sensors, infrastructure topology and condition, along with environmental (e.g. local weather and visibility) and road and traffic conditions. Such a digital twin can allow monitoring and preventively optimising both safety and traffic flow, equally addressing congestion and resilience issues. Results from existing projects like OMICRON could be considered. The proposals should also explore the possibility and usefulness of other type of data such as sociodemographic and economic data, behavioural driving data, data from security cameras, among others that could be provided by third parties (tourism, planned events, demand, etc.);
	Analyse in detail the technical challenges associated with the acquisition and use of adequate and reliable big data from multiple sensors in the road transport system, as well as the process of combining these datasets in ways that are meaningful for proactive road safety analysis;
	Develop methods and tools to predict safety-critical traffic situations at quantifiable risk levels based on real-time and historical data;
	Account for biases in the datasets and ensure that the developed AI-based models or algorithms are bias-free, so that the safety of all road users will be improved effectively in a fair, non-discriminatory way;
	Analyse in detail also the non-technical challenges associated with this approach and the inherent need to collect and share large amounts of data that can be used to identify and quantify road safety-related risk factors. Ethical, legal and economic issues should be considered and concepts be developed to overcome these challenges in terms of privacy concerns, questions of data ownership, organisational barriers etc;
	Analyse what real-time countermeasures can be taken to reduce instantaneous risk levels for all road users complementary to existing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) services;
	Demonstrate the feasibility of such risk predictions and targeted interventions;
	Build consensus among relevant stakeholders on possible routes for deployment in coordination with other ITS services.


Particular attention should be dedicated on establishing interoperability standards for data sharing, through the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and leveraging on already adopted practices especially those in the relevant Common European data spaces.

Ways to leverage valuable complementary data, e.g. metadata from crash databases, should also be explored, as well as links to initiatives for European data spaces.

Research is expected to develop recommendations for updates to relevant standards and legal frameworks. International cooperation is advised, in particular with projects or partners from the US, Japan, Singapore and Australia. Knowledge and experience from other modes where similar approaches are followed in much more controlled environments should be leveraged.

	Ice crystal and SLDs Ice Detection systems to optimise Ice crystals protection or support the detect and exit the SLD appendix O or a portion of the appendix O conditions;
	High Efficiency/Low Energy protection: cleaner aviation with more electric airplanes will drive the need for new ice protection technology: more effective and with less energy, active, passive and hybrid technologies (e.g., low ice-adhesion durable coatings and including new air mobility products (e.g., low speed propeller icing concerns);
	Dissimilar means for Air data (angle of attack (AOA)/Speed) measurement and insensitive to icing threat. Air speed and aircraft attitude measurements are crucial for aircraft control. Air data/navigation probes are externally mounted and exposed to adverse conditions. Dissimilar means to determine the aircraft speed and altitude would provide benefits and make the air data system even more robust and fault tolerant to environmental conditions (icing or hail);
	Enhanced aircraft performance and in particular ice protection health monitoring by improving the ice protection system monitoring coverage based on smart systems capable to monitor a large number of aircraft parameters.


This research and innovation topic is linked to several ongoing rulemaking actions of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency:


	RES.0010 Ice Crystal Detection
	RES.0017 Icing hazard linked to super cooled large droplets (SLD)
	RES.0014 Air-data enhanced fault detection and diagnosis
	RMT.0196 Update of the flight simulation training device requirements
	RMT.0118 Analysis of on-ground wing contamination effect on take-off performance degradation


A close cooperation with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and with notational aviation authorities during the implementation of this project should be envisioned.

Complementarities with other ongoing and upcoming Horizon Europe projects are expected to be ensured as well as with the European Digital Twin of Ocean (European DTO) and its core infrastructure, for instance the projects funded under topics:


	HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-CLIMATE-02: The ocean-climate-biodiversity-people nexus: uncovering safe operating space for safeguarding the integrity and health of the global ocean;
	HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-08: EU Digital Twin Ocean: Contribution to the EU DTO core infrastructure through applications for sustainable ocean management;

	HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-08: Integration of socio-ecological models into the Digital Twin Ocean;
	HORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-02-08 Minimisation of environmental, and optimisation of socio-economic impacts in the deployment, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind farms.


In addition to considering the most evident environmental impacts of offshore wind energy systems (displacement, collision risk, exposure to aerial and underwater noise, habitat loss and degradation, pollution, etc.), funded projects must include an analysis of possible new impacts, that may become particularly relevant when a high number of wind energy systems is deployed, for instance in relation to the decommissioning and removal of end-of-life offshore wind energy systems, the presence of dynamic cables suspended in the water column, the impact of submarine geohazards on the dynamic cables or the production of microplastics.

Environmental monitoring data must be open source and be shared with the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the International Energy Agency Wind Energy Systems Technology Collaboration Programme’s (IEA Wind TCP) Task on the environmental effects of wind energy.

    'It is essential that smart buildings are flexible and adaptive to changing needs and usage patterns and are user-friendly to encourage widespread adoption of these technologies by grid operators, construction professionals, building facility managers and users. Furthermore, to ensure the societal benefits of the smart building technologies there is a need for increased user knowledge, acceptance and satisfaction.

Proposals are expected to address all of the following:


	Develop solutions that enhance the smartness of buildings by using and facilitating the upgrade of existing Building (Energy) Management Systems (BMS/BEMS) and/or other technical equipment;
	Ensure that the proposed solutions are user-friendly and provide the expected indoor environmental quality, as well as user satisfaction and occupant comfort;
	Demonstrate the proposed solutions in at least three pilots. These pilots should collectively cover at least three different climatic zones, three different building types (residential, tertiary etc.), and three different technical building systems;
	Develop a methodology to measure the achieved energy demand reduction, increased flexibility in the grid, and enhanced interoperability, compared to current best practices;
	Investigate the cost-effectiveness and replicability of the proposed solutions.


This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:


	Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.
	This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities.

    'Although much research has focused on developing materials and products with reduced whole life carbon emissions, the life cycle impacts of buildings depend on a complex interaction between individual products, components and technical building systems, spatial distribution, usage during their lifetime, and other design choices. There is therefore a need to deliver buildings and renovation works with minimal life cycle impacts, in particular global warming potential, based on circularity principles, also accommodating future building use-change through design for flexibility, and using innovative combinations of products and systems that result in optimal building-level performance.

Proposals are expected to address all the following:


	Develop solutions that facilitate optimal combinations of construction products and systems with minimal life cycle environmental impacts at the level of the building. The optimal combinations of products and systems must also account for relevant aspects of performance such as structural integrity, thermal, acoustic and hygrometric, durability, potential for deconstruction and preparation for reuse at end of life, and potential for automated or industrialised installation. The solutions should cover, among others, the design and construction phases of work;
	Develop decision-related processes and strategies for adaptive reuse of existing structures, such as repurposing buildings as opposed to demolish and rebuild, considering the whole life carbon emissions;
	Validate the solutions, processes and strategies in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics;
	Research the whole life carbon emissions of the developed solutions on typical building typologies in the chosen countries and contribute to whole life carbon benchmarking efforts;
	Consider the cost effectiveness of the developed solutions including relevant business models taking into consideration end-user needs;
	Contribute to the development of European standards, where relevant;
	Contribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and to the Built4People network of innovation clusters.


Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission''s Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on circular design and building solutions that reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and enable carbon removals, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.

This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

Projects are expected to also evaluate how these technologies could contribute to the EU’s energy security and industrial competitiveness through detailed value chain analysis and development of future scenarios, macroeconomic modelling, and strategic decision-making methods. Value chains closer to commercialisation with the potential to contribute more to the EU 2030 targets for green transition and industrial competitiveness and value chains for technologies under development with the potential to contribute to the longer term and could duly adopt mitigation measures, are both in scope. Proposals are expected to identify the research and innovation actions needed to improve the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of these value chains, and implement as appropriate research activities for such optimisation, as well as new standards definitions for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs as appropriate.

Competitiveness, energy security and integration challenges of the various steps in a value chain and of the relevant stakeholders are expected to be addressed. Integration aspects encompass every step of each individual value chain and every stakeholder. Proposals are expected to coordinate efforts towards development of win-win integrated solutions of sustainable value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin engaging all relevant stakeholders, including as relevant farmers, CO2 suppliers, technology providers, researchers, fuel producers, end users, policy makers, international organisations. Multidisciplinary issues related to advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin production, carbon removals, CO2 trading and valorisation, sustainable farming, production of nature-based soil amendments, fertilizers, and organic materials, fuel standardisation, trade-off/synergies of carbon farming with in-situ carbon storing and of land uses for fuels versus solar panels for derived fuels, are expected to be considered, to achieve benefits for all through the integration.

Value chains of renewable hydrogen as an end-product are not within the scope of this topic.

The project proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway and timeline to obtaining the permits.

The project has to assess the sustainability of the proposed solutions in environmental and socio-economic terms. Furthermore, the Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) sets a framework for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials which should be considered as a reference for project proposals.

Plans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic are expected to include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).

    'To achieve the Green Deal objectives for 2030 and 2050, substantial investments are required in a smart and digitally enabled energy system capable of integrating higher shares of renewable energy and electrification of demand and electricity storage. This encompasses various sectors such as transport (notably electric vehicles), industry (heating and hydrogen production) and residential heating.

On-going innovation in the energy data space, smart Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, and digital twins for energy systems, coupled with energy price and market considerations, provide the foundation for advanced energy system intelligence. This intelligence will be further enhanced by leveraging generative artificial intelligence and the emerging AI Factories.

The scope is to develop and pilot prototypes of a generative AI-powered digital spine that enhances the digitalisation and decarbonisation of the EU energy system.

The overall scope is the development of a prototype of an automated, AI-powered, software-defined smart energy system leveraging and further developing existing (open-source) digital solutions of lower TRLs developed in EU and national research, innovation- and deployment-programmes, as well as AI algorithms and tools provided by the AI Factories, namely to:


	Develop and test the potential for generative AI to develop apps/programmes for local system optimisation and for system planning and operation;
	Develop and test generative AI that can identify sources of flexibility and provide solutions for interoperability and data exchange to enable decentralised optimisation of distributed assets. This includes the integration with various data sources and sectors, such as mobility, to promote decentralisation, energy-efficiency, and cost-efficiency and to enable interoperability across different parts of the energy system;
	Explore the potential of generative AI for system optimisation through scenario generation, simulation, and time series forecasting, while also developing optimisation tools for both supply-side and demand-side management using forecasts and data for renewable energy, transmission assets, storage, and energy-saving applications for consumers;
	Propose tools and control systems to apply generative AI solutions developed in a high-risk use-case (as defined in the AI act).


The developed solutions should be dynamic, flexible, offering reconfigurable automated management, control and data exchange to ensure seamless operations across decentralised a setting.

    'Proposals should consider the integration in the existing energy grids and interaction with other urban uses of the subsurface (e.g., subways, underground utilities, buildings), including energy geostructures of buildings, tunnels, slabs, energy sheet pile walls, etc., with potential geothermal heating, cooling, and sinks or storage opportunities.

Proposals should address the uncertainties in the seasonal energy demand to increase the predictability of the required subsurface space, the interactions among systems for the sake of optimal use of subsurface and thermal efficiency.

Projects are expected to deploy one or more demonstrators and can address, for example, one or more of the following exemplary areas:


	Optimal utilisation of geothermal resources and thermal energy storage in urban settings, addressing high (above 70 degrees Celsius), medium (30-70 degrees Celsius) and/or low temperatures (10-30 degrees Celsius) and possible requirements for retrofitting of the building stock;
	Subsurface models for a sustainable underground thermal storage and geothermal use in cities;
	The integration of heat pumps, advanced thermal storage, and interface with district heating infrastructures to contribute to the thermal and power grid flexibility;
	Studying the impact of subsurface urban heat islands (SUHI) on the potential of shallow geothermal energy use in cities, using, for instance, long-term subsurface monitoring networks, satellite monitoring and models;
	Best practices strategies for subsurface land-use plans in European cities; well/borehole placement strategies;
	Mutual interaction of existing and future neighbouring UTES systems from geotechnical, energy, and regulatory point of view;
	Management of energy grids on an urban scale and system optimisation thorough digital twins predicting operational, environmental and economic response, as well as the interaction between the storage system and the local grids, under different scenarios;
	Creation of large (time and scale-wise) open multisensory datasets to foster heat energy storage at the European scale which should adhere to the FAIR data principles, adopt data quality standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data sharing/access good practices developed by the European research infrastructures, where relevant.
	Use of advanced monitoring systems such as fibre optic sensors, satellite imagery, etc. for monitoring and early detection of adverse impact of UTES at a district scale level and providing measures to mitigate such effects.


Consideration should be given to de-risking solutions, and dedicated support schemes that guide innovative energy storage technologies through to the commercialisation stage. The consortium should assess the current regulatory context and provide recommendations linked to the proposed solutions for shaping future needs (e.g., regulatory, standardisation, permitting). In addition, appropriate local community engagement initiatives as well as expectations and experiences of underground thermal storage infrastructures (and to what extent it varies in dense urban areas) should be explored.

This topic requires citizens engagement and dialogue and the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities and ensure the translation of innovation into real-life outputs.

	Point sources, or
	Directly from air (direct air capture, DAC).


Depending on the capture routes chosen (e.g., solvents, sorbents, membranes, cryogenic, solid looping), examples of important issues to address include enhanced absorption/adsorption, improved kinetics and reduced energy use for CO2 capture and desorption, new materials with high selectivity for CO2 capture, flexibility of operation, modularisation and scale-up, space occupation, degradation and life span of capture materials, ability for retrofit, potential for heat integration, and solvent-induced corrosion.

In particular for DAC, examples of important issues to address are novel sorbent or solvent materials that have higher CO2 capture capacities and longer-term stability in the presence of heat and air. For all proposals, minimisation of health and environmental impact must be addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up. The developed technologies should aim at delivering CO2 at the specifications required for transport and storage, with very low levels of impurities.

For point-source capture, the technologies should address the performance profile and characteristic when operating under variable operating conditions such as load changes to maintain and as high as possible capture rate across the entire operating profile. Results from point-source capture should provide good matches between specific industrial application and capture technology while guaranteeing the quality and continuity of the industrial process.

The use of the European Research Infrastructure for CO2 Capture, Utilisation, Transport and Storage ECCSEL is encouraged but not mandatory.

Building value chain actors - such as housing association, municipal and regional authorities, or policy makers - require planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative building solutions and define pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of the building stock and the built environment under their responsibility.

Proposals are expected to address all of the following:


	Develop and validate replicable and scalable planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative sets of building solutions when developing or regenerating (including deconstruction aspects when relevant) the building stock and the built environment;
	Validate the planning methods, procedures and sets of building solutions in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics. In at least two cases, the proposed planning methods and procedures should be relevant for renovation;
	Investigate the use of innovative tools and methods which facilitate the adaptation of the buildings stock to changing user needs, while positively contributing to occupants’ comfort and health;
	Propose and apply a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the developed pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of buildings and the built environment, including the calculation of their whole life carbon reduction compared to a “business as usual” scenario;
	Ensure the active involvement of all relevant public and private stakeholders of the whole renovation and construction value chain, which must include among others: municipalities, citizens (including vulnerable groups) and civil society organisations and the building and construction sector professions;
	Contribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and its network of innovation clusters.


Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission''s Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on innovative building solutions for resource efficiency, safety, durability and adaptability of the building stock, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.

This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise (including social innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People).

In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices.

	Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices;
	Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules;
	Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination;
	Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials;
	Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology.
	Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process.


Proposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer.

Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).

This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

    'The 15-minute City Transition Pathway (15mC TP) addresses challenges of urban mobility, logistics, public space and proximity-based policies to promote implementation of climate neutral, resilient neighbourhoods for all. It draws on research and innovation projects to showcase a diverse mosaic of approaches that drive mobility transitions. The 15mC TP aims to enable analysis, development and testing of ideas, tools and innovations for 15-minute cities within co-creative and transdisciplinary settings.

The Circular Urban Economies Transition Pathway (CUE TP) aims to foster urban places, communities and neighbourhoods that are sustained by circular resource flows and enhance the wellbeing of their inhabitants and ecosystems. It encourages urban planning and design characterised by regenerative urbanism, favouring the combination of circular principles, urban greening, and equal access to urban spaces and resources.

The Positive Energy Districts Transition Pathway (PED TP) aims to develop innovative solutions for planning, large-scale implementation, and replication of PEDs across Europe’s urban and peri-urban areas. By combining energy efficiency, renewable energy production, and energy flexibility at the local level, PEDs offer and contribute to affordable energy systems, affordable quality housing, and competitive, resilient and inclusive local economies for cities through energy communities, contributing to European goals such as the SET Plan and the EU Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities.

    'Project PartnershipApplicants can be: 


	research organisations (higher education institutions including universities, university colleges; research institutes or other entities with research undertakings), 
	companies and commercial organisations, 
	urban government authorities (such as regional and local government institutions, municipalities and municipal organisations, city authorities, urban public administrations, and infrastructure and service providers), 
	consumers and civil society representatives (e.g. local and community organisations, non-governmental organisations, not-for-profit organisations, citizens’ representatives, etc.). 
	From the culture and creative sectors (e.g. artists and designers)


Eligibility rules for the consortia and Applicants: 

Transnational eligibility rule 1: 


	Each proposal must be submitted by a consortium consisting of at least three eligible Applicants from at least three different participating countries (see Annex A). Only Applicants eligible for funding by the participating Funding Agencies from the following countries are eligible to apply as Main Applicant or Co-applicant: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Tunisia and Türkiye. 
	In addition, at least two of the eligible Applicants must be from different EU Member States (MS) or Associated Countries (AC) to the Horizon Europe eligible for EC co-funding in this Call: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and Türkiye. 
	All legal entities must be independent from each other to be considered as different applicants. 
	Please pay careful attention to the specific Funding Agencies’ rules regarding eligibility of applicants in Annex A since not all Funding Agencies can support all types of Applicants.
	Ineligible Applicants (e.g. from other countries or ineligible to receive funding from a participating Funding Agency) may participate as a Cooperation Partner.


Transnational eligibility rule 2: 


	The Main Applicant (project coordinator) must be eligible to be funded and request funding by its national/regional participating Funding Agency.


Transnational eligibility rule 3: A Principal Investigator (PI) must only participate in a maximum of two proposals, and only once as the PI of a Main Applicant. If the DUT Call Secretariat, in charge of checking transnational eligibility, identifies the same person as PI in more than two pre-proposals, or as PI of the Main Applicant of more than one pre-proposal, all pre-proposals/full proposals in which they are a PI, will be declared ineligible.

Transnational eligibility rule 4: 


	Consortia must include at least one urban governmentauthority (city, municipality or entity providing key urban services, so long as this entity is owned by a local government (confirmation of this by the local government may be requested by the Call Secretariat)) either as a Main Applicant, Co-applicant, or Cooperation Partner depending on the national/regional eligibility criteria.',

    'UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs)',
    'Additional InformationPre-proposals/full proposals must be prepared in English using the designated mandatory proposal form. Proposals written in other languages will be ineligible.

The proposal form should be filled in completely.

Pre-proposals and full proposals must respect the total number of pages using a standard font size and normal page margins as indicated on the proposal form.

Pre-proposals and full proposals must be submitted on the UEFISCDI electronic submission system, UDiManager (www.uefiscdi-direct.ro), before each associated deadline:


	the Call for pre-proposals is open until 17 November 2025, 13:00 (CET).
	In March 2025, applicants will be invited to enter the second stage of the procedure: the Call for full proposals will close on 23 April 2026, 13:00 (CEST).


An online help document with guidelines for submission will be provided, detailing the procedures and duties of the Main Applicant and of other consortium partners.

It is not possible to resubmit or revise the pre-proposal/full proposal after the submission deadline, unless it pertains to corrections to technical administrative details and is requested by the Call Secretariat.

Only pre-proposals invited to submit a full proposal will be eligible in the second stage of the selection procedure. If a Main Applicant decides to submit a full proposal rejected at the end of the first stage, this full proposal will be declared ineligible.

No fundamental changes initiated by the applicants alone between the pre-proposal and the full proposal will be accepted. Namely:


	the project objectives stated in the pre-proposal cannot be changed,
	the Main Applicant (and its PI) must stay the same, except in case of force majeure,
	the consortium (co-applicants) should stay the same (with the exception of the Inclusion possibilities allowed explicitly by the Call Secretariat, see call document section 4.1),
	only minor changes on the funding demand per Funding Agency can be allowed (except in the case adding Inclusion Procedure partners).
	changes in the consortium structure requested as part of the Fallback Procedure (see section 3.7 of the call document) are considered modifications requested by the Call Secretariat and are therefore exempt from this rule. The Call Secretariat may allow such modifications in exceptional cases, if duly justified.


Modifications requested by a Funding Agency do not count as changes between the pre-proposal and the full proposal stages.

By submitting a pre-proposal/full proposal, applicants agree that it will be forwarded to all Funding Agencies, which are receiving a request to provide funding for that proposal.

Some Funding Agencies require submission of information on a national/regional level as well (see Annex A).',

	Advance early detection of VBDs through the development of novel diagnostic tests that identify these diseases at an early stage, enabling timely treatment and control.
	Increasing the accuracy and specificity of existing diagnostic assays to better identify VBD pathogens, thus minimising misdiagnoses.


Supported actions will need to advance beyond the current R&I status and, where applicable, must also take into account ongoing Union projects, such as under Horizon Europe, guaranteeing complementary. This will expand diagnostic capabilities to address emerging and re-emerging pathogens in the Union, by providing advanced tools to monitor and respond to outbreaks.

Updating diagnostic technologies to improve accuracy, speed, and accessibility and theoptimisation of diagnostic technologies such as molecular assays and serological tests, shouldbe supported by evidence on novel antigens or genetic sequences, including clinical testing.

    'The call seeks to fund two innovative projects that implement the following activities in all covered Member States.

1. Design a participatory process involving young Europeans and influencers

The consortium will design and implement a participatory process to allow young Europeans to share their ideas, questions and concerns related to the online information space and information integrity, involving them in the creation and dissemination of engaging content to address information integrity and safety online. The objective is to ensure strong involvement of young Europeans as well as influencers at all stages, from design to delivery. This aims to ensure that the multimedia content, and the campaigns designed to disseminate it, are as targeted and relevant as possible to young Europeans’ interests while also leveraging on the experience, knowledge and follower base of influencers.

2. Produce youth-oriented content related to the threats to information integrity and ways to counter them

The consortium will produce engaging multilingual multimedia content that caters to the needs and preferences and consumption habits of 15- to 30-year-olds across all covered Member States.

3. Develop a wide, cross-national and inclusive media literacy campaign 

The consortium will design and implement a comprehensive digital media campaign that will ensure an EU-wide and as broad as possible dissemination of the multimedia content produced under point 2. The campaign will also serve to maintain an overview of all activities related to the project and to collect relevant metrics on reach and impact (audiences reached via the different channels used, number and quality of interactions with the campaign content, etc.). The campaign’s key messages will support the objective of this Call for proposals, which is to promote critical thinking and responsible online behaviour among young Europeans aged 15–30 by helping them identify, understand and counter the mechanisms that threaten information integrity.

4. Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and standards on information integrity

The consortium will apply ethical guidelines and standards on information integrity in their partnerships with influencers and in the whole process for producing and disseminating multimedia content. This will ensure that the output is accurate, trustworthy, ethical, and privacy-respecting.

    'Project PartnershipProject must have one LP and one or more PPs. Based on the experience, the optimal size of the partnership is 4-6 PPs per project. Such number of PPs allows to ensure effective management and coordination of partnership. Nevertheless, involvement of LP/PPs has to be justified. When deciding how many partners to involve the projects should consider what is the best for the achieving of the project outputs and results.

Project has to involve at least one Lithuanian and at least one Latvian partner, which are registered or permanently located and actively operate in the Programme area. PPs from both countries should be represented.

Partners registered outside the Programme area can participate only if it is crucial for achieving of the project objectives, and competence or knowledge of such partners do not exist in the Programme area.

The following organisations are eligible to apply as a LP or PP:


	Public authorities (national, regional and local authorities).
	Public equivalent bodies. Meaning any legal entity:
	
		established for the specific purpose of meeting the needs for the general interest and not having an industrial or commercial character,
		having legal personality, and
		
			financed for the most part by the state, regional or local authorities, or other bodies governed under public law, or
			subject to management supervision by those bodies, or
			having an administrative, managerial, or supervisory board where more than half of the members are appointed by the state, regional or local authorities, or other bodies governed by public law.
		
		
	
	
	NGOs. Within the framework of the Programme NGO means a legal body established for the specific purpose of meeting the needs for the general interest and not having an industrial or commercial character.


Each project must meet at least three out of four cooperation criteria:


	Joint development (mandatory): The LP and all PPs must jointly develop project. It must clearly integrate ideas, expectations, priorities and contributions from all PPs. LP and PPs must share understanding of the project objective and contribute to achieving of its results. Project partnership should be balanced in terms of project objectives. Plus, all PPs must benefit from the project and also bring their knowledge and  competence to the project and its area.
	Joint implementation (mandatory): The LP and all PPs must jointly coordinate and implement activities of their project. The division of tasks and responsibilities must be balanced, the activities of each partner must be clearly linked, and the partnership must communicate regularly.
	Joint financing (mandatory): The budgets of LP and all PPs together form the joint budget of the whole project.
	Joint staffing (optional): The functions of the project staff on either side of the border should not duplicate and the staff on both sides of the border should work together on the project.',

As additional requirements, it is obligatory that at least 1/3 of the project partners are newcomers to the Programme and that the whole partnership (project and associated partners) includes minimum 10 organisations. At the same time, the Programme primarily supports multilateral cooperation with the inclusion of organisations from more Programme Member States.

Please note: the eligibility of project partners – especially NGOS and SMEs – shall be consulted with the Contact Point of the region where the given partner is located. The contact details are here: https://southbaltic.eu/contact-us/

The Programme defines newcomer as an organisation that fulfill both conditions below:


	Did not participate in approved regular project(s) financed under the Interreg South Baltic Programme 2014-2020;
	Does not participate in approved regular and/or Small-scale project(s) financed under the Interreg South Baltic Programme 2021-2027.


Besides organisations that have not participated in any Interreg South Baltic project, the following organisations that previously participated in Interreg South Baltic projects may be considered as newcomers if they were:


	Project partners of Interreg South Baltic Programme 2007-2013;
	Associated partners in any Interreg South Baltic Programme project type and financial perspective;
	Seed money project partners in any edition of the Interreg South Baltic Programme.


Only project partners are considered when calculating the number of newcomers in the project, i.e. associated partners are excluded from this requirement. In case of rounding, the mathematical rules apply, i.e. rounding up from 0,5. To comply with the requirement the following number of newcomers shall be included as project partners:

    'Mandatory partnershipYes',
    'Project PartnershipThe minimum requirement for projects is to have two project partners from the Programme Area from two different Member States. The Programme strongly emphasises that projects involving project partners from the Programme area from only two Member States are not the prime target and can be funded only in exceptional and well justified cases. Cooperation of project partners from the Programme area from at least three different Member States are supported by the Programme foremost.

As a general rule, the size and the composition of the partnership shall correspond to the planned project activities, therefore the number of project partners in individual projects may differ from the recommended project size. The minimum requirement sets the smallest partnership, but it is strongly recommended to involve relevant partners from the whole Programme area to demonstrate its authentic cross-border nature.

Based on previous experience, the recommended partnership size is 6–8 partners in a regular project.

In each project, one partner should be introduced with a leading role representing the whole partnership, and act as a lead partner.

Cross-border cooperation among different organisations is the core of the South Baltic Programme. The projects are expected to apply it throughout their lifetime, demonstrating compliance with four cooperation criteria: joint development, implementation, staffing and financing.


In order to act as a lead partner in the South Baltic Programme project an organization has to meet the following criteria:


	Eligible legal form:
	
		national, regional and local authorities;
		bodies governed by public law (as defined in Art 2(1) of Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC (OJ L 94, 28.3.2014). This means bodies that have all of the following characteristics:
		
			established, under public or private law, for the specific purpose of meeting needs in the general interest, not having an industrial or commercial character, and
			having legal personality, and 
			financed, for the most part, by the State, regional or local authorities, or other bodies governed by public law; or subject to management supervision by those bodies; or having an administrative, managerial or supervisory board, more than half of whose members are appointed by the State, regional or local authorities, or by other bodies governed by public law associations of one or several regional or local authorities;
		
		
		associations of one or several bodies governed by public law;
		European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) (as defined in the Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 as amended by Regulation (EU) No 1302/2013).
	
	
	Eligible geographical location:
	Programme area (referring to the legal address of the organisation)
	In justified cases, organisations of national or regional level that are located outside the Programme area but in the Programme Member State and have a recognizable impact and/or functional links with the Programme area. In such cases it is strongly recommended that the JS is contacted in advance to confirm eligibility.
	The national/regional authorities which have territorial jurisdiction over the Programme region also can become lead partners if justified.

    'Specific Objective 1.2 - Development of skills for advancing smart specialisation strategies, industrial transformation and transition towards industry 4.0, including cross-sectorial collaborations

3rd call thematic focus: AI skills development for delivering products and services with transnational impact in the Danube Region

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and redefining how businesses operate globally. In the Danube Region, there is an urgent need to equip organisations with AI-related skills to enhance competitiveness, drive innovation, and ensure sustainable economic growth. This 3rd call thematic scope is also strongly linked to the EC COM (2025) 163 A modernised Cohesion policy: The mid-term review stating that “digitalisation of public services and the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the public and private sectors are levers for competitiveness.

This 3rd CfP is targeting projects that foster AI skills development, enabling primarily public and private non-profit organisations supporting businesses, start-ups, and professionals to leverage AI technologies for transnational collaboration, digital transformation, and creation of high-value products and services.

Specific Objective 2.1 - Support greening the energy and transport sectors in the Danube Region by enhancing the integration of renewable energy sources

3rd call thematic focus: Considering the provisions outlined in the “Energy transition” section of “A modernised Cohesion policy: The mid-term review” (MTR, COM(2025) 163 final) published by the European Commission and taking into account the still growing need for sustainable, renewable energy solutions in line with the IP of the Interreg Danube Region highlights the necessity to define a targeted 3rd call for “sustainable renewable energy solutions in the context of energy production, heating and cooling systems, grid load, energy communities, district heating and cooling, storage and peak load reduction” directly linked to focus 1 of SO2.1 “Increasing the share of renewable energy in the Danube region”.

Specific Objective 2.2 - Promoting climate change adaptation capacities in the Danube Region and disaster management on transnational level in relation to environmental risks taking into account ecosystem-based approaches

3rd call thematic focus: The proposed applications can address the three thematic focuses of SO 2.2, but should target broader territorial scope beyond the urban, municipal level, where transnational level harmonisation and coordination of forecasting, monitoring, preparedness, or reaction is necessary (targeting the Danube River Basin, or its main sub-basins, or the Danube Region, a thematically reasonable, broad and coherent transnational space within, covering the targeted area in its entirety – e.g. a transnational river network, a broad transnational area of DR affected by the same environmental risk with potential transboundary impact) in connection to climate change adaptation and / or climate change induced environmental risks (floods, droughts, wild fires),or accidental pollution of rivers.

Specific Objective 2.3 - Sustainable, integrated, transnational water and sediment management in the Danube River Basin ensuring good quality and quantity of waters and sediment balance

3rd call thematic focus: Proposals can address thematic focus 2 (harmonising management practices between relevant sectors to improve the quality and quantity of transnational water bodies) and thematic focus 3 (transnational coordination of water supply management in transnational river(basin)s) of SO2.3. More specifically, the proposed applications should target potential impacts of climate change on transnational water management by harmonising and coordinating policy approaches, management practises between water management, agriculture, environment, navigation and hydropower to improve the quantity (and quality) of water in transnational river systems of DRB with key topics in relation to water scarcity, balanced use of water and coordinated management of low-water periods on transnational rivers of DRB (considering also that flood management is related to SO 2.2). This thematic scope is also in strong connection with the COM/2025/0084 regulation proposal, which aligns cohesion policy investments to the new challenges and priorities identified by the mid-term review of the Cohesion Policy, among others adding water resilience to the scope of water management. The geographic scope of the proposals shall be on the whole Danube River Basin, or at least a sufficiently broad part of it, major transnational river(s), river basin and possibly in the entirety of the targeted river basin.

Specific Objective 3.1 - Accessible, inclusive and effective labour markets

3rd call thematic focus: Capacity building for employment support bodies (information and data systems; coordination; training e.g. in social economy). The context in which employment services are operating in the Danube Region is characterised by rapid change, driven in large part by demographic shifts, migration, digital transformation and the green transition. Consequently, new forms of employment, skills, social attitudes and career paths are needed in the DR to support our labour markets and society more widely. Our aim is to build the capacity of employment services to respond to the challenges and prepare services in support of effective, agile, inclusive and resilient labour markets. This could include new or improved information and data systems; coordinating structures and processes between services and supporting stakeholders; developing service capacity through innovative training methodologies - for example in social economy, AI, skills assessment, inclusion, etc. Indicative examples from one of the DR challenges, of the type of approaches that could fit within the scope of this specific objective can be seen below.

Specific Objective 3.2 - Accessible and inclusive quality services in education, training and lifelong learning

3rd call thematic focus 1: To strengthen Danube Region strategic approaches in support of Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs) in the Danube Region.

A Danube Region strategic support approach for CoVEs should build on the work of the existing EUSDR Danube Region Platform on Centres of Vocational Excellence/Policy Platform for CoVEs started in 2021 Danube Region Platform on Centres of Vocational Excellence - EUSDR - Danube Strategy Point. A Danube Region project(s) could complement and further develop this initiative with a more coordinating/operational approach, which could include:


	Pilot programmes of work with a transnational character on specific areas of work, e.g. internationalization of CoVEs, CoVEs and social inclusion, public private partnerships; CoVEs and smart specialization; lifelong learning
	Creating networks, forums and working groups on specific themes connecting VET policy makers and providers with companies and industry representatives across the Danube Region
	Developing a support function for the understanding, guidance and complementarity of different programmes in the Danube Region supporting CoVEs (national, regional, transnational)
	Awareness and capacity building programmes for CoVEs in the Danube Region
	Strategic CoVE development in fields of transnational interest across the Danube Region


3rd call thematic focus 2: The development of existing CoVEs or new CoVEs - developing their excellence potential

Projects should develop on one or more of the following directions:


	CoVE focussed initiatives to modernise and transform the quality of VET systems to strategically support social, economic and pedagogical changes and challenges, e.g. new skill needs in the context of the green and digital transition
	The formation of multilevel Public Private Partnerships for VET and skills development
	Actions aimed towards embedding CoVEs in local innovation ecosystems and connecting them at the Danube level
	Facilitating the bringing together of CoVEs that share a common interest in specific sectors and innovative approaches to tackling societal challenges e.g. social inclusion, green skills, digitalisation, AI, upskilling individuals with low qualification levels, etc.


Specific Objective 4.2 - Increased institutional capacities for territorial and macro-regional governance

Four 3rd call thematic focuses have been identified for specific objective 4.2. Applicants are not requested to address all the four thematic focuses of the 3rd call, but they shall concentrate on and demonstrate in their application strong contribution to at least one thematic focus. Addressing two or more thematic focuses is not considered an advantage for the applicant and will not lead to additional points automatically since the assessment considers the quality of the proposal in its entirety.

    'The programme mission is to bring regions and cities together beyond borders to find fitting solutions for their citizens – in a fair and equal way everywhere. It encourages and supports transnational cooperation to make regions more resilient to common challenges that know no borders and which cannot be solved alone. These challenges include among others economic transition processes, climate change, and the long-term socioeconomic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The programme priorities and specific objectives form the backbone of the Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE funding strategy in 2021-27. In line with the thematic fields, transnational cooperation actions are expected to address the development and implementation of strategies, action plans, tools, training, pilot actions and related solutions. All actions will have to respect the horizontal principles of sustainable development including environmental protection as well as equal opportunities, non-discrimination and gender equality.

Priority 1:  Cooperating for a smarter central Europe


	
	SO 1.1 Strengthening innovation capacities in central Europe
	Strong innovation capacities bear enormous relevance for central Europe considering its strong industrial base and the importance of sectors such as agriculture and food, or tourism. Innovation is also central for strengthening central Europe’s economic resilience. Capacities for innovation need to be fostered especially in regions that are struggling with the transition to a more globalised, digitalised and green economy. Knowledge and technology transfer, especially for SMEs, is a critical need.
	
	
	SO 1.2  Strenghtening skills for smart specialisation, industrial transition and entrepreneurship in central Europe
	The strong industrial base of central Europe and its dependence on adequate skills underlines the strategic relevance of this specific objective. SMEs have been identified as the main providers of employment in central Europe and it is important to foster locally available human skills, especially for the transition to Industry 4.0, digitalisation and a green economy. Capacities for an efficient entrepreneurial discovery process need to be improved as well as for the preparation or updating of smart specialisation strategies. Place-based development of skills is also crucial for reducing urban-rural disparities. Overall, there is the need for a just transition process that is socially responsible.
	


Priority 2:  Cooperating for a greener central Europe


	
	SO 2.1  Supporting the energy transition to a climate-neutral central Europe
	Central Europe needs to speed up its performance related both to energy efficiency as well as the production and use of renewable energy to meet EU targets and climate objectives of the European Green Deal. Significant regional disparities between central European regions have to be tackled. Energy efficiency and renewable energy need to be promoted and exploited to reach a wider geographical coverage.
	
	
	SO 2.2. Increasing the resilience to climate change risks in central Europe
	Resilience to climate change risks represents an important need for central Europe, especially in view of its significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. A specific territorial aspect is the need for integrated and cross-sectoral approaches to best adapt to climate change. In order to build up climate resilience, general approaches need to be locally adapted towards workable and manageable, integrated solutions which can be proliferated across the entire central Europe area.
	
	
	SO 2.3. Taking circular economy forward in central Europe
	A climate-neutral, resource-efficient and competitive economy requires up-scaled circular approaches. This economic transformation has to pay attention to the fact that a circular economy will often require a re- arrangement of value chains, changes of interdependencies and the creation of new profit options. It is important that this socio-economic transformation happens across the entire territory of central Europe and does not concentrate on only a few regions.
	
	
	SO 2.4. Safeguarding the environment in central Europe
	The economic and environmental significance of natural assets and landscapes in central Europe calls for a co-ordinated valorisation and protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. There is a strong need to counteract negative effects of human action through integrated environmental management approaches.
	
	
	SO 2.5. Greening urban mobility in central Europe
	A reduction of transport emissions is one of the key targets of the European Green Deal. Smart and greener urban mobility will need an integrated response. Many functional urban areas in central Europe face similar challenges when greening their mobility. The specific territorial need lies in the vast diversity of topics (e.g. pollution and congestion) that need to be addressed in an integrated approach. Furthermore, the topic does not only include different ways of mobility, but also urban as well as urban-rural logistics.
	


Priority 3:  Cooperating for a better connected Europe


	
	SO 3.1. Improving transport connections of rural and peripheral regions in central Europe
	The programme area is a relevant junction in Europe. This can strategically facilitate the participation in trade and increase competitiveness. Accessibility to larger transport corridors is, however, comparatively weak. There is a need to link especially peripheral regions to the nodes of the TEN-T core network corridors (CNC), to remove bottlenecks and to bridge missing transport links in order to ensure good accessibility across central Europe. Furthermore, there is the need to reduce transport emissions by 90% by 2050, which calls for smart and sustainable approaches to cross-border mobility, intermodality and the introduction of IT-supported solutions for mobility management.
	


Priority 4:  Improving governance for cooperation in central Europe


	
	SO 4.1  Strengthening  governance  for  integrated  territorial  development  in central Europe
	Central Europe is highly heterogeneous both in territorial as well as in socio-economic terms. A multitude of challenges and barriers hinders the economic, social and territorial development in central Europe, which are not necessarily bound to specific administrative units. They rather relate to areas with functional ties that are characterised by economic, social, and environmental linkages. Addressing these territorial development challenges calls for integrated multi-level and multi-sectoral governance processes that consider functional linkages at the territorial level. There is a need to improve capacities of public authorities on all territorial levels for setting up and implementing integrated territorial development strategies. Cooperation should be encouraged within and between territories that are sharing functional ties.

EGTCs), Research Institution incl. University, Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)',
    'Mandatory partnershipYes',
    'Project PartnershipAs minimum requirement, the partnership must involve:


	at least three financing partners;
	from at least three countries; and
	at least two of the partners located in Interreg CE regions.


As a general principle, the Interreg CE Programme supports cooperation between partners located in the programme area. The geographic location of an EGTC is considered to be in the country where it is registered and its costs shall be verified according to the control system established in that Member State.

Organisations from outside the programme area can also participate in projects - but only in exceptional cases, i.e. when they qualify as:


	Assimilated partners, i.e. German and Italian national public authorities and bodies that are located outside the programme area, which:
	
		are competent in their scope of action for certain parts of the eligible area (e.g. ministries); and
		carry out activities that are beneficial for the regions in the programme area.
	
	
	EU partners from outside the programme area but inside the European Union. The following restrictions apply:
	
		Their participation must bring clear added value and expertise to the implementation of a project and has to be beneficial for the programme area.
		They cannot take the LP role.
		Should activities to be carried out by these partners be considered as State aid relevant, the participation of these partners will finally not be allowed.
		The legal status of these partners has to be confirmed by the competent national authorities of the respective Member State outside the programme area. The process to obtain such confirmation will be coordinated by the MA/JS. However, the confirmation has to be granted within 45 calendar days counted from the date of the MC funding decision for the call.
		Their participation in a project will be subject to the condition that the respective Member State signs an agreement with the MA on the acceptance of all management, control and audit responsibilities as well as of liabilities in case of irregularities. If this agreement is not signed within 12 months from the date of the MC decision for funding, the concerned partner will be excluded from the project. In addition, the agreement shall be accompanied by a description of the national control system for the verification of expenditure incurred and paid by beneficiaries located in the respective Member State. The MA/JS will contact the relevant national authorities immediately  after the MC decision for funding projects with partners located in EU regions outside the programme area.
	
	
	Third country partners, i.e. organisations located in countries outside the EU, can participate as associated partners but cannot receive ERDF funding from the Interreg CE Programme.',
